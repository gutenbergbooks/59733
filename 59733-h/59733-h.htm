<h2 class="oneline">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The story of the brilliant career of Eugene,
generally known as Prince Eugene of Savoy,
has its special lesson for youth. He was
intended for the Church, but was ambitious for a
military career. Louis the Fourteenth had marked
out for him the profession of an <i>abb&eacute;</i>; but monarchs,
even the most powerful, do not always dispose.
When &ldquo;the little Capuchin,&rdquo; as he was contemptuously
called, applied to that sovereign for a commission
in the French army and was refused it, he
shook the French dust from his feet and went to
Austria, resolved that France some day should suffer
for that refusal. The story shows how his resolution
was carried out. The Austrian Emperor gladly
welcomed him. He rose from a subordinate position
in the army to become one of the greatest generals
of his time. All Europe felt the strength of the
&ldquo;little Capuchin&rsquo;s&rdquo; arm. He was a born soldier
and war was the passion of his life. His career,
seems almost like an inspiration. He won battles,
often against largely superior forces, by the rapidity
and dash of his attacks, by a personal courage which
never wavered, and by a magnetic influence which
inspired the admiration of his own soldiers and fear
among his enemies. He was in the field more than
fifty years. The ten peaceful years of his life were
devoted to literature and the arts; but the battle-field
was the scene of his life&rsquo;s success. The story
which his life has for youth is the result which may
be accomplished, not merely on battle-fields, but in
every department of action, by determined purpose,
resolute will, and tireless industry. The &ldquo;little
Capuchin&rdquo; spurned the ease and comfort and luxury
of an <i>abb&eacute;</i> for the rough fare of the soldier, and made
himself the foremost general of his time by the exercise
of these qualities.</p>

<h2 class="oneline" id="c1">Prologue</h2>
<p>Prince Eugene, the great warrior and statesman,
although scion of an Italian family, and
by birth a Frenchman, became a thorough
German. He appeared at a critical time in the relations
between Germany and France, to save his
adopted fatherland from destruction, and to illuminate
the darkest period of German history with the
glory of a series of the most splendid and heroic
achievements. The historian Von Sybel calls him
&ldquo;the greatest general and statesman of Austria.&rdquo; As
a statesman he overtops the greatest of his successors,
Kaunitz and Stadion. As a general he fills a place,
chronologically and in rank, just between Gustavus
Adolphus and Frederick the Great. He was a dashing
hero and at the same time possessed a sympathetic
nature. He was a genial companion, a
conscientious patriot, a master in politics, and an
upright man. Wherever he appeared he charmed.
Although a born Frenchman of Italian stock, he
showed truer German feeling and spirit than most
of the Austrian leaders. He was one of those characters
whom any nation might be proud to possess.
He served the Austrian imperial house for fifty-three
years, thereby contributing to the glory of
the country.</p>

greatest generals and statesmen of all times.
This strange French-sounding name may seem odd
for a German hero; but in this case it is quite misleading,
for no one ever had deeper German sympathies;
no German soldier ever hated the people
on the banks of the Seine more bitterly. He gave
them plenty of hard blows, and has been christened
by the German people&mdash;and not without reason&mdash;&ldquo;Prince
Eugene, the chivalrous knight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Prince Eugene was born in Paris, although his
ancestral land was Savoy, the well-known duchy,
formerly part of upper Italy, a barren mountainous
country. He first saw the light in the capital city
of that country which was afterwards to suffer so
cruelly by his mailed hand. The ways of Providence
often seem strange, as in this instance, when
in the heart of France the man was born who was to
teach France and the Frenchmen respect for the
Germans. France had ever been arrogant toward
Germany, and was particularly so at that time and
until, in 1813-14-15 and later in 1870 and 1871, she
was taught a wholesome lesson.</p>
<p>And now I must tell you how Prince Eugene came
to be born in Paris. In the first half of the seventeenth
century Prince Thomas Francis of Savoy,
youngest son of the reigning Duke Charles Emanuel
the First, founded the collateral line of the house
of Savoy-Carignan. His wife was Marie of Bourbon,
sister and heiress of the last Count of Soissons;
his two sons, Emanuel Philibert and Eugene Maurice.
The latter took the title of Count of Soissons and
married Olympia Mancini, a niece of the notorious
French minister, Mazarin. From this marriage
sprang three daughters and five sons, of whom Prince
Eugene was the youngest.</p>
<p>History tells us that Prince Eugene&rsquo;s father was
a man of gracious manners and of a brave and genial
disposition. He distinguished himself in feats of
arms, and was therefore a favorite at the court of
King Louis the Fourteenth of France. Eugene&rsquo;s
mother was a beautiful woman and very fond of the
gay life of the time; to her all the homage was rendered
that feminine beauty and wit were wont to
receive at the brilliant court of &ldquo;His Most Christian
Majesty.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The palace of Count Eugene Maurice of Soissons
was situated upon the site where the great Grain
Market of Paris now stands. If one of my readers
should happen to visit that city he may look upon
the spot and meditate upon the instability of all
earthly things.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> This palace had a long, memorable,
and brilliant history. In the fourteenth century
it was the property of King John of Bohemia, of
the house of Luxembourg; it next served as the
cloister of a sect of expiatory nuns and later passed
into the hands of the notorious Catherine de Medici,
who furnished it in all the extravagant taste of the
time. It stood in the midst of splendid gardens,
embellished with fountains and colonnades; and in
the interior of the park was a chapel of truly royal
magnificence. It may be, that in this sacred spot
Catherine de Medici, mother of that monster, Charles
IX, may have conceived the idea, for the advancement
and honor of her church, of the Paris massacre.
It was in this palace that Eugene was born, October
18, 1663, one hundred and fifty years before the great
battle of Leipzig, a victory which broke the power of
the first Napoleon over Germany. This date, which
the year 1813 made a memorable one for Germany,
would seem more suitably marked in our calendars
by the name of &ldquo;Eugene&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lebrecht&rdquo; rather than
by that of some saint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Before we concern ourselves with Eugene or his
parents, let us finish the history of the palace of
Soissons. For almost a century it remained in the
hands of the family. Then a dishonest Scot by the
name of Law founded a bank in Paris, which soon
became bankrupt, beggaring many thousands of the
well-to-do citizens. At last the city of Paris bought
the ill-fated building in order to erect on the site
of so much crime and sin, wild lust and miserable
treachery, a very practical building, the above-mentioned
Grain Market, thereby to wipe out the
dark past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Eugene&rsquo;s cradle stood in the midst of gay and luxurious
surroundings. The palace of Soissons was the
resort of the flower of the French nobility. Brilliant
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, in which the King never failed to be among
the guests, followed one another, and the youthful
mistress, the beautiful Italian, Olympia Mancini,
was the flower of them all. At last the magnet lost
its power, as it is ever prone to do where court life
is subject to the moods and caprices of a tyrannical
ruler. Intrigues were set on foot against the Count
and Countess of Soissons; their powerful relative,
the minister Mazarin, had long been dead, and both
of them were banished from the court by a royal
decree dated March 30, 1665, and ordered to their
country estates. One can imagine the feelings of
Olympia particularly, who had been the petted
favorite and ornament of the royal court for years.
She shed no vain tears over her fate, however, but
cherished in her heart a thirst for revenge. She
now hated with a deadly hatred the King whom
she had loved and honored, and this sentiment she
inculcated in her children. This seed, hatred of the
house of Bourbon and particularly of the King, fell
in good soil. Her son Eugene preserved this heritage
from his mother throughout his whole life.</p>
<p>Eugene was ten years old when his father suddenly
died. After this blow, fortune seemed utterly to
forsake the Countess. In order to retrieve it, she
was ready to seize on any means, even the most
unworthy. She studied astrology and fortune telling,
and in this way became associated with a person
named Voisin, who was finally prosecuted as a poisoner.
Just in time Olympia, learning that she was
to be arrested as an accomplice, fled to Flanders.
But even abroad, in Brussels, she was pursued by
the hatred of her former friends. It was Louis&rsquo;s
minister Louvois particularly who heaped insults
upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>For the honor of Eugene&rsquo;s mother, the Countess
of Soissons, it must be said that the totally unfounded
rumors against her were at last silenced. Not a
trace of complicity with the crime of the Voisin
woman has been discovered. The talented Countess
soon made many influential friends in Brussels. Her
salon became very popular, and these social triumphs
somewhat compensated for the wrongs suffered in
Paris.</p>
<p>At the time of her flight the Countess had left
her children with the mother of her deceased husband,
the Princess of Carignan. Their grandmother sought
to give them a good education and to provide for
their future. Four of her grandsons were already in
the army, three in France, and one, Julius, in the
German imperial service; but she had difficulties
with Eugene, the fifth and youngest. In short,
Eugene was intended for the priesthood, but was
determined to become a soldier instead. Of princely
birth, as a member of the clergy, his future would
have been secure; in time he might have enjoyed
fat revenues, and sometime and somewhere have
occupied a bishop&rsquo;s seat. This goal might have
tempted many of his rank, but it was not so with
him. He might also have entered into service at
court and would probably have prospered outwardly
there, but with his nature and talents how
unhappy he would have been if thus misplaced! The
mere thought of becoming a courtier and toady of
his French majesty, the &ldquo;Most Christian King,&rdquo; who
was as bigoted as he was godless, treacherous, and
unjust; who had driven Eugene&rsquo;s parents into banishment
and had heaped unjust suspicion, insult, and
injury upon his mother, was repugnant to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>He was firmly resolved to become a soldier. In
his earliest youth he had shown a pronounced, even
unconquerable predilection for the profession, and
had concentrated all his dreams and hopes and his
whole education upon it. Mathematics had always
been his favorite study. With resolute purpose he
had applied himself to the study of geometry under
a friend of Vauban, the great French master of fortifications,
whose excellent buildings, walls, moats,
redoubts, lunettes, and bastions caused German
soldiers trouble enough, even in the last war. His
favorite book was the life of Alexander, the great
King of Macedonia, by Curtius; his principal models
were Hannibal and C&aelig;sar. He would pore over
every work on battles and sieges he could find, and
his eyes glistened when he heard the clashing of
weapons. Possessing such tastes and talents, there
was but one insuperable obstacle to his becoming a
soldier: he was of a very delicate physique and had
been sickly in his early years. Although he persistently
exercised and took every means to harden and
toughen himself, his nature could not be altered,
and to his great chagrin he remained small and
delicate even when he had reached maturity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be a soldier for all that,&rdquo; he often said
with great determination to those who good naturedly
meant to discourage him, and then he would
add: &ldquo;but no carpet-knight or soldier on parade,
like those who guard the Louvre day and night that
His Majesty may sleep soundly, and who swagger
about in gold and silver braid, conniving at the
adventures of the princes and royal family. No! I
wish to be a real soldier; one who is ready in the face
of any hardship to do his sworn duty to the death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his good grandmother of the house of Bourbon
probably smiled and shook her finger in warning;
and no doubt her grandson answered her: &ldquo;If
it be God&rsquo;s will, you shall yet see me a field-marshal
at the head of an army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was useless to gainsay such a spirit as this.
Eugene had a head of his own, as they say, and had
quietly made up his mind to let time solve the
problem. There was still another difficulty and a
very serious one. The will of the King had destined
the little fatherless boy, whom circumstances had
also deprived of a mother&rsquo;s guidance, for the Church
instead of the army. It is very likely that he thought
that such an obstinate little princeling of the house
of Savoy should not be allowed to have his own way,
but must be taught to obey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>We shall see what came to pass. Of course it
was impossible to contend with a Louis the Fourteenth,
for he had plenty of means for compelling
obedience. He had long ago made up his mind to
break this youthful obstinacy and prevent Eugene
from entering the French army. At last came the
time when Eugene must decide. Through good
friends he had several times tried to sound the King&rsquo;s
disposition in the matter, and always with discouraging
results. Eugene, whom the King sarcastically
called &ldquo;the little <i>abb&eacute;</i>&rdquo; said to himself: &ldquo;You must
be a man, and if you ever intend to march at the
head of an army and confront an enemy armed to
the teeth, you cannot afford to be afraid of the King
of France! So there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One fine day Eugene begged for an audience,
which was granted. At last he stood before His
Majesty, King Louis the Fourteenth, whom his
creatures called &ldquo;The Great.&rdquo; Eugene and Louis!
One cannot imagine two natures more unlike in
every respect, inwardly and outwardly. One elevated
Germany to a position of honor and power;
the other would have been glad to drag it down in
order to be worshipped as its ruler. Standing erect,
with clear and honest eyes, in a resolute voice,
Eugene presented to the King his petition for a
commission in the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>When he had finished, the King&rsquo;s eyes rested upon
him for some moments with an expression of derision.
The &ldquo;little <i>abb&eacute;</i>&rdquo; had never before seemed so
repulsive to him. Eugene certainly was far from
being a paragon of beauty. His complexion was
dark, he was small in stature, and his nose was comparatively
large. His upper lip was so short that
his mouth remained constantly open, disclosing
the front teeth. The redeeming feature was his
eyes which, intelligent and fiery, gazed intently at
the King as though they would read his fate from his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are disobedient, <i>abb&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; said the King in a
cutting voice; &ldquo;you oppose my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your will, Your Majesty,&rdquo; answered Eugene,
&ldquo;but only an office for which I have no inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not fit for a soldier,&rdquo; said the King,
measuring him from head to foot with an almost
disdainful look. &ldquo;You will never be able to bear
the hardships of the service. As I happen to know,
your father had destined you for the priesthood.
Take back your petition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my ancestors have followed the profession
of arms,&rdquo; answered Eugene; &ldquo;it is the most honorable
one for a prince, it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence with your arguments,&rdquo; interrupted the
King; &ldquo;I am in no mood to listen to them. You
know my wish. I will suffer no contradiction. A
prince of Savoy-Carignan should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here the
King cleared his throat and could not at once find
the right expression for what he wished to say.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>PRINCE EUGENE

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Should,&rdquo; Eugene took up the unfinished remark,
&ldquo;should at least have the liberty of deciding his own
future and of choosing his profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little <i>abb&eacute;</i> is excited,&rdquo; said the King in a
disdainful tone. Then he continued, &ldquo;It shall be
as I have commanded. Your Reverence must enter
into holy orders very shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Eugene with a firmness
of voice and manner far beyond his years (for he
was then only seventeen), &ldquo;you force me to declare
that I shall embrace the profession of arms in spite
of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not under my flag, not in France,&rdquo; cried the
King forbiddingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am compelled to seek another sovereign
and another fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, Prince. You are dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eugene immediately obeyed this command. His
future was decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This person&rsquo;s face is very repulsive to me,&rdquo; said
the King to his courtiers. &ldquo;The Soissons were all
pig-headed and this fellow has inherited his mother&rsquo;s
audacious spirit besides. Louvois is right, all these
Soissons must learn to submit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>So thought the King. But man proposes; God
disposes. This Soissons (Eugene) at least did not
feel the power of the King of France; the reverse
was the case, which we shall see as our history
proceeds. The heart of Prince Eugene was light as a
feather when he had turned his back upon the King
and his grand palace. Now all was clear between
them; he had spoken his mind and told the King the
truth, as he had probably never heard it spoken
before by one of his vassals.</p>
<p>When one considers, it was certainly a very daring
procedure. Abruptly and quickly he had broken all
the ties that bound him to the King and his house.
It was certainly not a bad thing to have the powerful
King of France for a cousin. Had Eugene,
according to the King&rsquo;s demand, become a priest,
he would have fared well, might have folded his
hands on his knees and have enjoyed a very comfortable
living. But now it was necessary to stand on
his own feet and to act with hands and brain. Thousands
would certainly have decided differently, would
have preferred the certain to the uncertain and have
considered that a piece of bread in the mouth is
better than a feather in the cap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Eugene did not belong to this order of mankind.
Fate had early taken him in hand. His father&rsquo;s
cares and his mother&rsquo;s tears had sunk deeply into
his heart. He was too good a son to forget easily
the wrongs inflicted by the King. He had also been
early introduced to the frivolous life at court, and had
conceived a disgust for it. Thirdly and lastly, he
had a lively faith in God. He believed firmly in
an all-wise heavenly control of the universe, had
put his trust in the King of kings, and was at peace
with himself. He would never have been a successful
priest, but he was enthusiastic for the profession
of arms.</p>
<p>The next problem for Eugene to solve was, under
whom he should seek service. France was not the
world. There were many potentates under whose
banners he could find honor and fame. He hesitated
but a short time; then his intuition came to
his aid and he chose the German Emperor. Strangely
enough, although a Frenchman by birth, his heart
had always turned to Germany; from youth German
deeds of valor had inspired him. Added to this,
his uncle, the Duke of Savoy, was on the most friendly
terms with the Emperor Leopold the First, and his
brother Julius, who had entered the imperial service
shortly before, had already been assigned to the
command of a regiment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Eugene lost no time. He said farewell to his
grandmother and to his brothers and sisters, and
packed his belongings. These, no doubt, were not
numerous, for his pleasure-loving mother had attended
to that; and besides, the parental legacy had
been widely distributed. But this troubled Eugene
very little. In eating, in drinking, and in dress he
was accustomed to the greatest simplicity; and in
case of need he had a rich uncle in Savoy, who
would have considered it a disgrace, as he had a
great deal of family pride, to let his young relative
suffer want.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a single servant, Eugene left
Paris and shook the dust of the proud capital from
his feet. It is said that he vowed never to enter
France again except as her enemy, sword in hand,
at the head of a German army. We shall see later
how this came to pass. And now let us heartily
wish good luck to our determined young Savoyard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Siege of Vienna</span></h2>
<p>Eugene arrived at last in Vienna, although the
journey then consumed much longer time
than it does to-day. This had its advantages,
for one had time to consider one&rsquo;s plans and to make
up one&rsquo;s mind whether one were doing the right thing
or not. But, as we already know, Eugene was not
the man to vacillate when once he had decided.
When he had the goal before him he made straight
for it, looking neither to right nor left; in fine, he
no doubt felt that God was leading him; and this
is the best guide for us all, whether prince or beggar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>At the royal castle in Vienna he was very kindly
received. He had not grown handsomer or statelier
on the road from Paris to Vienna; but Emperor
Leopold overlooked these externals and saw something
deeper. Eugene&rsquo;s firmness of bearing, his
directness of speech, and his whole personality impressed
him. There were other considerations also
which influenced the Emperor. Like Eugene, he
had been destined in youth for the Church; he was
also pleased to have princes and cousins of the
already powerful Duke of Savoy, flocking to his banner
at a time when the operations of the rapacious
and murderous Turk were becoming more and more
of a menace to Vienna. Every German sword that
freely offered itself was welcomed as a real acquisition.
So thought the Emperor. To be sure the
Viennese had other ideas, for with all their amiability
they have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>The little Prince of Savoy-Carignan was almost
too tiny for them. When they had heard his story,
they scarcely blamed the French King for having
destined this little chap for the priesthood. They
insisted that he was not fit for war. They called
him &ldquo;The little Capuchin&rdquo;&mdash;a name which fitted
him, for he generally wore a long brown cloak which
closely resembled a monk&rsquo;s habit. Very often
people stopped on the streets, shaking their heads,
to gaze after him. Eugene would have had to be
very obtuse not to have noticed this. At present
it could not be helped, but he no doubt thought to
himself, &ldquo;Just wait, and sooner or later the little
Capuchin will show you what he can do.&rdquo; There
was that within him which neither the edicts of a
king of France nor the jokes of the Viennese could
subdue; genius was bound to assert itself. His
opportunity soon came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The Turks as well as the French were enemies
of the empire at that time. Until quite recent times
the German people were accustomed, in their church
prayers, to call on God for protection against both
these enemies. The French were constantly harassing
the empire on its western frontier, and the
Turks on the eastern. Here and there great domains
were taken, and it is only to be wondered at that
under such desperate circumstances it did not go
quite to pieces. This shows how full of tenacity
and endurance the German people were. The worst
of the situation at that time was that &ldquo;the Most
Christian&rdquo; King of France encouraged the Turks
and was playing the game with them. He argued
that if the Germans were busy in Vienna with the
Turks, the Emperor could not send an army to the
Rhine; and the beautiful country on both sides of
this river had long excited his cupidity. Shortly
before this (1681) Strasburg had fallen into his
hands through abominable treachery. Such a rich
morsel had excited Louis the Fourteenth&rsquo;s appetite
anew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>In Hungary, which was the portal of entry into
the empire for the Turks, the ruler was an adventurous
spirit and a dare-devil soldier, named T&ouml;kely,
who had been bribed by Louis. Indeed, as many
historians tell us, he had a secret understanding with
the Turks for the destruction of Germany. It was
very difficult to accomplish this from the French
side, for here a stanch German prince opposed him
and defended German rights against the impious
attacks of the French. This German prince was
Frederick William, the great elector of Brandenburg.
You see it was even then one of the Hohenzollerns
who entered the lists in Germany&rsquo;s behalf; how long
they have been misunderstood and accused of base
schemes of conquest!</p>
<p>But let us pass from the Hohenzollerns to the
French, Hungarians, and Turks. The Emperor had
concluded a twenty-years&rsquo; armistice with the last of
these after the battle of St. Gotthard. This was
now nearly at an end. If the court of Vienna had
made good use of it, the Turks never would have
dared to attack this still powerful enemy. As it
was, they had been sitting with folded hands, idle
and impassive. The imperial army was small in
numbers and insufficiently fitted out. The fortresses
in Hungary were in a neglected condition, and the
country itself was kept in disorder and insurrection
by T&ouml;kely and his lawless followers. Thus it was
an easy matter for the Turks to subdue not only
Hungary but other sections of Austria, and to carry
the victorious crescent to the very gates of Vienna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>It was during this period of nervous anxiety that,
by imperial command, Prince Eugene was given a
lieutenant&rsquo;s commission in the dragoon regiment of
his brother, Prince Julius Louis of Savoy-Carignan,
in order that he might win his spurs under the
latter&rsquo;s eye. The commander of the imperial army
was Duke Charles of Lorraine, who had a tale to
tell of the French King&rsquo;s arrogance, as he also had
been spurned in that country. What must have
been Prince Eugene&rsquo;s feelings when he first donned
the imperial uniform! His entry into the Austrian
army gives us much food for thought. His future
had not been foretold from the cradle; but who
knows what would have become of the German
fatherland had he gone to Spain instead of to Austria;
had he never striven against the Turks; if in the
Spanish war of succession he had fought against
instead of for Germany; if the French instead of
being his enemies had been his friends?</p>
<p>Instantly the torch of war was ablaze. The
Turks and Hungarians, uniting, pushed forward from
the lower Danube. Burning villages and towns,
desolated landscapes, hunger, misery, and all the
horrors of war marked their path. Many thousands
of youths and maidens fell into their hands, to be
carried away as hostages or to be sold into slavery.
All was confusion, and no one could suggest a remedy.
The whole Austrian army numbered 35,000 men,
and the Turks were 200,000 strong. What a contrast!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The operations of the Emperor&rsquo;s troops were
mostly unsuccessful. They were anxious to hinder
the enemy&rsquo;s advance, so that the Viennese might
have time to strengthen their intrenchments. Perceiving
this, the Grand Vizier pushed rapidly forward
to the Leitha; and in order not to be cut off
from Vienna, Duke Charles of Lorraine was obliged
to change his position. He was attacked with furious
impetuosity at Petronell, July 7, 1683, by the
advance-guard of the Turkish army. It was a
bloody engagement, for it was necessary for the
Germans to defend themselves at any cost.</p>
<p>It was there that Eugene met the enemy for the
first time and proved himself a soldier. He fought
as bravely as the best, keeping at his brother&rsquo;s side,
wherever the danger was greatest. The King of
France should have seen the little <i>abb&eacute;</i> in this
wild cavalry encounter&mdash;he would certainly have
changed his mind. Despite their ardor the Turks
were obliged to retire, and this pleased Eugene
mightily. But unfortunately the joy of victory was
embittered by a great sorrow. His beloved brother
Julius was a victim of the day&rsquo;s work and was found,
terribly disfigured, under the horses&rsquo; hoofs. Eugene
shed some bitter tears, said a prayer for his brother&rsquo;s
soul, then pressed on after the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>But it was impossible to stem the tide of their
superior numbers; already they had surrounded
Vienna, and a division of Turkish cavalry had taken
possession of one of the suburbs, where they were
conducting themselves in truly barbaric style. That
could not be tolerated. The Margrave, Louis of
Baden, who had succeeded Prince Julius Louis of
Soissons as commander of the dragoon regiment,
attacked the Turks, sabre in hand, cut down many
of them and put the rest to flight. Eugene took
part in this fight with enthusiasm; as also a few days
later at Presburg, where the Duke of Lorraine defeated
the rear-guard of the enemy. Here also the
dragoons of the Margrave Louis of Baden did their
part, and Eugene distinguished himself above all
the rest.</p>
<p>In the meantime the main army of the Turks, under
command of the Grand Vizier, Kora Mustapha, had
entirely surrounded Vienna. Such peril had never
before befallen a German city. All Germany was
in a fever of excitement. It was plain that, should
Vienna fall, the whole German empire would be
open to the marauding and murdering infidels; and
God knows what might come next. But it turned
out differently. The mayor of Vienna, Rudiger von
Starhemberg, was a good soldier as well as administrator.
Here he encouraged, there led an attack;
and the Viennese citizens and students fought like
heroes under his leadership. Although the Turks
stormed the walls and had even made a breach here
and there, they were obliged to retreat before the
defenders, who were fighting for their dearest and
most sacred possessions. The good Viennese, however,
would have been obliged at last to succumb,
had not help come from the Electors of Bavaria and
Saxony, the Emperor&rsquo;s troops under Duke Charles
of Lorraine, and with them, of course, the chief of
the dragoon regiment, Margrave Louis of Baden,
with &ldquo;the little Capuchin,&rdquo; Prince Eugene, all led
by King John Sobieski of Poland. The Capuchin
was already become a mighty hero; Eugene had
smelled powder, and even the dragoons, who had at
first regarded him doubtfully, had quite changed
their minds about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The decisive battle took place September 12, 1683,
under the walls of Vienna. The assistance was
timely, for the city could scarce have held out twenty-four
hours longer. The Turks had been bombarding
it since the fifteenth of July. It was a wonder that
it had resisted so long. The last day was destined
to be the hardest one for the Viennese. The Grand
Vizier had divided his army. Legions attacked the
deliverers on the Kalenberg, and other legions were
commanded to take the city. For a long time the
outcome was uncertain. The Turks fought with
incomparable ferocity and recklessness; and it became
necessary for the Germans to exert their strength
to the utmost against their attacks. The fury and
confusion were terrible, the slaughter unparalleled.
Wild cries to Allah mingled with the groans and
prayers of the Christians. Blood flowed in streams,
and the trenches were filled with the corpses of friend
and foe alike. It was well that the decisive moment
was at hand, for the defenders had expended their
last effort. At length the trumpeters sounded the
glad tidings of victory from the Cathedral tower of
St. Stephen, from whence the flight of the Turks
could be seen. It was heroic work, in which every
man did his share, and especially Prince Eugene.
With the Duke of Lorraine, he pushed down the steep
declivity of Leopoldsberg toward Nussdorf, then
along the banks of the Danube, in pursuit of the
enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Once more the Turks made a sharp and ferocious
attack on the walls and intrenchments of Vienna.
Although repulsed on the outside, they were determined
to take the city. The danger increased, but
little more patience and endurance was needed, for
help was at hand. Margrave Louis of Baden detected
the greatest danger-point at the Schottenthor
(Scotch Gate). With three battalions of infantry
and his dragoon regiment he cut his way to this
point. He wished to outflank the enemy and give
the Viennese a breathing spell. Prince Eugene was
at every point where the danger was greatest. With
his dragoons he was the first to enter the Scotch
Gate. What a slashing and butchering there was!
It was necessary to effect a meeting with Starhemberg.
The long blades of the dragoons did terrific
execution among the enemy. At the head stormed
the &ldquo;little Capuchin,&rdquo; giving orders here and striking
a blow there, until he heard trumpet calls from
the other side. It was Starhemberg, and the Turks
were between two fires; there was no longer any
escape, they must go down in this sea of fire and
flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Vienna was saved. The Turks fled, and the
dragoons kept close at their heels. Order had now
to be restored in all directions.</p>
<p>A little defeat which the Polish cavalry had suffered
on the seventh of October at Parkan was
revenged two days later by the reunited army.
Margrave Louis of Baden took the city by storm;
then Gran surrendered, and this closed the famous
campaign of the year 1683.</p>
<p>Before the year had closed Prince Eugene had
received the thanks of the Emperor for his gallantry.
On the twelfth of December, 1683, he was appointed
Commander and Colonel of the Kuefstein regiment
of dragoons; and this fine regiment he retained without
a break during his long career. For a long time
it had the honor of being a model for the whole
imperial cavalry. And is it a wonder? Prince
Eugene understood his profession and was a past
master in the art of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Turkish Campaigns</span></h2>
<p>Although there were no telegraph stations
at that time nor any railroads, it soon
became known in Versailles and Paris that
the &ldquo;little abb&eacute;&rdquo; had fought very gallantly, and
that his bravery had received recognition from the
Emperor. What must Louis have felt when he
heard this news? He was too crafty to betray himself;
but Louvois was less self-contained, and cried
in his wrath: &ldquo;This fellow shall never again enter
France.&rdquo; It was easy for this presumptuous minister
to issue his commands, but the fulfilment of
his purpose was not in his power. Eugene had
now gained an assured position. His commanding
officer, the Field-Marshal General, Margrave Louis
of Baden, a man for those times very well informed
and an accomplished soldier, possessed far more discrimination
than the King of France displayed in
that memorable audience at the Louvre; he recommended
Eugene to the Emperor with the words:
&ldquo;In time this young Savoyard will be the equal of
all those whom the world considers great generals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The campaign of 1684 was quickly opened, but
without particular success. It is a long distance
from Vienna to Stamboul, and there was much to be
done before the enemy could be despatched thither.
They still had their strongholds in Hungary, and such
neighbors were dangerous. It was necessary above
all to seize Buda.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> At first this was unsuccessful;
indeed, the Germans were obliged to go into winter
quarters without having accomplished anything; then
they had to put the city in a state of siege and to resist
the advance of the Turkish army of relief. Starhemberg
proposed to take Neuh&auml;usel first, this being
the only way to approach Buda. The good advice of
this experienced soldier was disregarded, and therefore
unfortunate consequences had to be endured.
It was not until the next year that the situation
improved. Other powers had gathered their forces
under the banners of the Austrian Emperor, including
Bavaria, Saxony, Brandenburg and twenty
thousand Hungarians who were opposed to T&ouml;kely
and chose to adhere to the Emperor rather than to
this impostor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Since the siege of Vienna, by the enemies of Christianity,
there had been an awakening among the
German princes; the common danger had called
for common defence. Of course Prince Eugene with
his regiment was not wanting. His post was on the
left wing of the imperial cavalry commanded by the
Prince Salm. Everything prospered so that Buda
was soon as completely surrounded as Vienna had
previously been by the Turks.</p>
<p>Eugene, with his dragoons, held a ravine road on
the south side of the fortress, which led between two
mountains into a broad plain. From this quarter
the Turks in Buda were expecting their relief forces;
and nearly every day there were skirmishes, in which,
however, the Turks always got the worst of it. How
dangerous these engagements were, is shown by the
fact that once Prince Eugene&rsquo;s horse was shot under
him, and another time he was wounded by an arrow.</p>
<p>The Turkish supporting army at last arrived, but
was completely vanquished, and the city was then
taken by storm. Eugene very nearly missed this
fun, for he was on sentry duty and was commanded
to remain at his post. But when he heard the thunder
of the field-pieces, great and small, the clash of
swords and the sound of the trumpets, he could no
longer contain himself. He quickly ordered a part
of his dragoons to mount, battered down a gate
with axes, and in a moment was in the thick of the
fray beside his victorious German brothers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Now began the second rout. Valiant Eugene had
the honor of chasing the enemy over the Danube.
Ha! that was merry work! Besides this, F&uuml;nfkirchen
was taken by Eugene&rsquo;s unmounted dragoons.
Once started, he would have done still more, had
not a very deplorable misunderstanding and jealousy
among the Emperor&rsquo;s commanders stopped all important
operations for some time to come. None
wished to obey another. Margrave Louis of Baden
dared to tell the Duke of Lorraine to his face, that
he was not obliged, as a German Prince, to take
orders from him. The young Elector of Bavaria,
Maximilian Emanuel, also made trouble.</p>
<p>This was a great disadvantage to the Germans,
and grieved Eugene deeply. The situation did not
improve until the Turks became more and more
menacing, and this danger brought the malcontents
to their senses. At last, on the twelfth of August,
1687, it was determined to attack the Turks at
Mohacz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Here, almost on the same spot where, one hundred
and sixty years earlier, King Louis the Second of
Hungary had lost empire and life to Suleyman, he
was at last avenged. The battle lasted only a short
time, but the victory was a decisive one. Like a
wall of brass the Germans slowly advanced. There
was no break of which their opponents could take
advantage. The attacks of the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry
broke against it, like the breaking of the sea against
the rocks. Again and again the Turks attacked,
and were driven back each time. Added to this, a
steady fire of musketry raked their lines, and the
cannon did their duty also. At last there was no
possibility of restraining the soldiers; and the time
had come, too, for Eugene to let loose his dragoons.
Like a whirlwind they threw themselves on the
Turks, whole regiments were ridden down and others
taken prisoners. Once more the Turks made a
stand behind their intrenchments; they thought
Eugene could not get at them there. But how mistaken
they were! Like lightning his dragoons were
off their horses, drew their sabres, stormed the barricades,
and cut down all who did not save themselves
by instant flight.</p>
<p>Thus the battle was decided; the lion&rsquo;s share of
the victory and of the glory was Eugene&rsquo;s. This,
no doubt, was appreciated by the Duke of Lorraine;
for as a reward for his daring dash at Mohacz, he
sent him in person to bear the news of victory to
Vienna. It was certainly a proud commission for
the valiant Prince! Arrived at the castle, he instantly
received audience and was presented by the
Emperor with his portrait richly set in diamonds.</p>
<p>After the battle of Mohacz Eugene&rsquo;s fame was
assured, his name was on every tongue. The king
of Spain bestowed upon him the Order of the Golden
Fleece; and his cousin, the reigning Duke of Savoy,
Victor Amadeus the First, delighted with the brilliant
success of his young relative, supplied him royally
with money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>How the gentlemen in Paris and Versailles must
have opened their eyes at all this! Their historical
works, as one can well believe, do not tell of any
distinction that Eugene received. King Louis must
have been thoroughly ashamed of his shortsightedness;
he had taken the rough diamond for a common
pebble. Prince Eugene became Lieutenant-Field-Marshal
in his twenty-fifth year. This was certainly
an unusual distinction. What is more important,
he became Lieutenant-Field-Marshal not through
the favor of the king, but on his own merits.</p>
<p>It was now most important for the Emperor to
regain possession of Belgrade. The last bulwark of
the Germans could not be allowed to remain in the
hands of the Turks. The Emperor commanded;
there was no hesitation. The Elector of Bavaria,
the Emperor&rsquo;s son-in-law, was now commander of
the imperial army after the valiant Duke Charles
of Lorraine had been diplomatically removed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The affair went splendidly. When the German
cannon had shot but two breaches in the walls, the
assault was made. Two columns advanced to the
fortifications, led by the Elector and Eugene. The
cry was: &ldquo;Long live the Emperor; long live Germany!&rdquo;
They advanced quite a long distance and
thought they had already won the day. But they
were mistaken; for a deep moat protected the real
fort and made a dangerous obstacle. There was
little time to consider; it was do&mdash;or die! In spite
of the continuous fire of the Turks, young Count
Starhemberg, nephew of the heroic Vienna Mayor,
called out: &ldquo;Follow me, he who loves the Emperor
and his country!&rdquo; He then sprang into the moat
up to his belt, his whole regiment following him.
But this was by no means the end. As they climbed
out of the moat, dripping wet, they had to take the
intrenchments. The Turks defended themselves
desperately, for they knew what it meant to lose
Belgrade. But the Elector and Eugene followed
hard upon the heels of the Starhemberg regiment.
There was a terrible hand-to-hand fight, while large
and small missiles fell right and left among the
attacking army. The Elector received an arrow-wound
in his face, a janissary gave the Prince of
Savoy a sword cut that clove his helmet. Eugene,
turning quickly, plunged his sword deep into the
Turk&rsquo;s breast. At that instant a musket-ball penetrated
his leg just above the knee, and he dropped,
still urging the attacking troops on to victory. He
was removed from the field, and soon the joyful news
was brought to him that Belgrade was taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The Prince&rsquo;s wound was extremely dangerous, for
the ball could not be found for some time; and several
months afterwards splinters of bone were removed
from the leg. Everything was done that science
could accomplish; Duke Victor Amadeus the Second
sent his own physician to Vienna. Later a lung
trouble developed; and it was not until January of
the year 1689 that the Prince could journey to Turin
to thank his cousin personally for all the kindness
and sympathy which had been shown him.</p>
<p>The victories of the Austrian Emperor over the
Turks had aroused tremendous jealousy at the court
of Versailles. Louis, &ldquo;the Most Christian King,&rdquo;
instead of assisting in the defence, was much cast
down at the defeat of the Turks, for he could not bear
to see a powerful German Emperor as a rival. He
now conceived a new plan and suddenly attacked
the Emperor and his strongholds. As both were
unprepared, he was very successful. Philippsburg
fell; Mayence opened its gates to him; and with the
connivance of the traitor F&uuml;rstenberg, coadjutor of
the Cologne bishopric, Bonn, Kaiserswerth, and
other fortified places passed into the hands of the
French. After these great victories over the Turks,
Emperor Leopold should have made peace with them
and turned all his energies against the French, an
opinion shared by all the princes of the empire.
Incredible as it may seem, he did not do this, and as
a consequence suddenly found himself between two
enemies. Now he had all he could do to save his
skin. It was a desperate situation; the hearts of
German patriots, and there were plenty at this
unfortunate time, were very heavy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>While Louis let loose in the Rhine provinces his
marauding bands, which plundered and burned more
than a hundred villages (the empty window-frames
of Heidelberg Castle still testify to the shameful
deeds of the French), he allied himself also with the
Duke of Savoy. He believed it possible to make
that country a point of vantage for attacks on the
Germans, although it was a somewhat roundabout
route. This was a very unpleasant surprise to the
Duke of Savoy. He would much have preferred to
keep quiet, a neutral observer of the bloody game of
war. But there was no choice. He was obliged to
decide and place himself either on the Austrian side
or else to make common cause with the French.
With a heavy heart, as is natural with weak characters,
he decided for the former. Eugene had
labored hard with him&mdash;had represented to him all
that the family of Carignan had suffered from the
French, and what would befall him should he become
a vassal of King Louis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>That decided him. A small German army (5,000
men) under the leadership of Caprara, Eugene with
them, entered Savoy; and as Spanish troops soon
came to their assistance, they confidently hoped to
discipline the arrogant French. But it turned out
differently. The Duke of Savoy played false, was
bought by French money, and betrayed all the plans
of the imperial leaders to the French general Catinat.
He permitted the dangerous bandit warfare of the
Piedmontese, the notorious sharp-shooters of modern
times, against the Austrians. The soldiers were
given poisoned food, several were murdered, small
groups of them were attacked, and even the life of
Eugene, who meanwhile had become a general of
cavalry, was conspired against. A troop of at least
one thousand men attempted to overwhelm his camp,
but were bravely routed by the Taaffe regiment.</p>
<p>It was difficult for Eugene to believe in the perfidy
of his uncle, whom he had truly loved and honored.
But the proofs accumulated. At last he had an
understanding with him, reproached him with his
treachery, and begged him urgently to desist and to
remain firmly attached to the Emperor&rsquo;s cause. The
Duke, who wished to aggrandize his domain, and
saw more advantage to himself through alliance
with France rather than with Austria, did not listen
to this advice but remained, as before, the secret
ally of the King of France; thus he did more harm to
the Austrian cause than a strongly armed enemy
would have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The war continued with varying success until the
year 1696. But it brought one real satisfaction to
Eugene; he kept his promise to himself and from the
Savoy mountains he entered France sword in hand,
at the head of an army. He had occupied many
French towns, when he received orders to retire to
Milanese territory. He obeyed with a light heart,
for an open-hearted, honest man is always at a disadvantage
against cunning, malignity, treachery,
and assassination. In Vienna an exceedingly gracious
and brilliant reception awaited him. No one
thought of blaming him for the ill success in Savoy.
He had done all that it was possible to do. He
became more and more devoted to the Emperor and
to the German cause; he wished to give loyalty for
loyalty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Battle of Zenta</span></h2>
<p>In the year 1697 we find Prince Eugene a Field-Marshal.
How did he arrive so quickly at
such high honors?</p>
<p>Old Count von Starhemberg, at that time president
of the Imperial Council of War, had recommended
him to the Emperor with the words: &ldquo;I know of no
one who possesses more understanding, experience,
industry, and zeal in the Emperor&rsquo;s service, no one
who is more generous and unselfish, or who possesses
the love of the soldiery to a higher degree, than
Prince Eugene of Savoy.&rdquo; This was a recommendation
which carried great weight, above all from the
mouth of so brave, thorough, and experienced a
soldier as old Starhemberg, the valiant defender of
Vienna. It was a time also when such a well recommended
man could be very useful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>All was quiet in Italy, to be sure; the campaign
on the Rhine was not being very actively conducted;
but in Hungary the arch-enemy of Christendom
threatened anew, and Eugene was the real scourge
of the Turks. This warlike nation had, in more
recent years, gained the ascendency through the
breaking up of the imperial forces. The Elector of
Saxony, Frederick August the Second, as the Emperor&rsquo;s
commander-in-chief, had not been man
enough to hold them back or destroy them. Fortunately,
just at the right time, he was relieved of
the command of the army, by accepting the throne
of Poland. In this position he injured the German
cause far less than he might have done as a soldier.
When the Emperor&rsquo;s troops in Hungary learned
that Prince Eugene was to command them again,
there was loud rejoicing. Starhemberg&rsquo;s words
about the love of the soldiers for him had already
proved themselves true. It was really from this
time that Eugene began his victorious career. He
had now to depend solely on himself; upon his own
powers, his own genius, and had no one above or
beside him to tie his hands.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that Belgrade had again
been taken from the Emperor. The Viennese Council
of War did not consider it prudent, just then, to
attempt its recapture, although Eugene would certainly
have accomplished the task. It was far more
necessary to furnish the half-starved army with
provisions and clothing, and to improve the very
loose discipline. For this latter task Eugene, with
all his mildness, was well fitted&mdash;for the soldiers
loved the thirty-two-year-old Field-Marshal like a
father, and love makes obedience easy. Eugene
gathered the scattered army together into camp at
Cobila. Here he learned that the Turkish ruler,
Mustapha the Second, was in Belgrade and had
built bridges over the rivers Danube and Save.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It was the universal opinion in the army that the
Turks intended to cross the Save and attack Peterwardein.
Eugene was the only one who understood
the situation. He saw that the Turks had quite a
different plan, and intended to push forward by forced
marches toward Siebenb&uuml;rgen to attack the eight
Austrian regiments under General Rabutin, who
were coming up. Leaving a sufficiently strong corps
behind to observe the enemy, Eugene marched with
the greater part of his forces along the Theiss to meet
Rabutin.</p>
<p>It turned out splendidly; the meeting took place;
and now Eugene determined to return to Peterwardein
to defend this fortress against possible attacks
of the enemy. He arrived there just in time to
prevent the Turks from destroying the bridges over
the marshes at St. Thomas-Syreck. A cheerful and
courageous spirit prevailed throughout the army;
the confidence of the leader communicated itself to
each individual soldier. Eugene had good spies
and scouts, those necessary evils of the army
even down to our day. From one of them he
learned that the Turks were going to advance on
Szegedin, take the city and then hurry on to
Siebenb&uuml;rgen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>As this had to be prevented under all circumstances,
Eugene hurried forward so quickly by forced
marches, that by the twelfth of September he was
within a mile of the enemy. He determined to
attack at once. You should have seen the former
little <i>abb&eacute;</i> or Capuchin now! The thought of fighting
his first battle independently, without interference
from any one, developed in the highest degree
all the latent resources of his genius. He was equally
ready in decision and in execution, and still his plans
were so well considered and to the point that, as an
eye witness declared, &ldquo;there was no loophole for the
goddess of chance to decide the day against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had Eugene completed the placing of
his army when a part of the Turkish cavalry made a
descent upon him. To repulse them with great loss
was an easy matter. And now the cannon began
to roar from all sides&mdash;a terrible concert. One
could see, from the continuous cloud of dust in the
Turkish camp, that the Austrians were hitting the
mark. After a sharp bombardment, the command
was given, &ldquo;Forward! march!&rdquo; The Turkish intrenchments
had to be taken in spite of a heavy fire
from the enemy&rsquo;s lines. It was a bloody piece of
work in which many a brave soldier bit the dust.
Very likely the columns sometimes hesitated, but
a glance at their brave leaders, their beloved Prince
Eugene at the head, urged them forward. During
this advance toward the enemy&rsquo;s front, Eugene had
ordered the left wing of the army, under Starhemberg,
to open a passage into the enemy&rsquo;s camp across
the sandbars of the Theiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>In spite of the desperate defence of the janissaries
who, attacked from the rear, fought with the courage
of despair, they were forced back step by step. The
Austrian lines reached the intrenchments, which
they carried with a rush and then began to scale the
walls. To heighten the courage of his soldiers still
more, Eugene himself led the cavalry regiment
Styrum into the fight. Once more a terrific conflict
broke out at the barricades, once more success seemed
doubtful. There was less and less room for the
cavalry to operate; there was nothing left but to
leave the outcome to the already decimated infantry.
But this the cavalry did not wish to do; they wanted
to claim a share in the honors of victory. Like
lightning they dismounted, mingling with the rapidly
advancing infantry, and together they threw
themselves against the intrenchments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The janissaries saw that they were lost, but they
resolved to sell their lives dearly. They threw away
their muskets and drew their sabres. A short but
terrible carnage began, man to man, eye to eye.
The Emperor&rsquo;s troops in the majority, holding the
advantage on every side, did terrible destruction.
At last, with cries like wild animals, the janissaries
turned for flight; all was not lost&mdash;the outlet over
the bridge was still open. Horrible delusion! The
general&rsquo;s eye had not failed here. The road to the
bridge had long since been cut off&mdash;no outlet in
any direction, no help! In wild confusion the Turks
swarmed the rocky banks of the Theiss, where they
were pushed, crowded by their own numbers and
driven into the water by the Austrians with loud
cries of victory, and thus most of them perished in
the river. Terrible conflicts such as these took
place all over the battle-field. Drunk with victory,
the soldiers seemed to crave blood. With cries of:
&ldquo;This for Vienna!&rdquo; &ldquo;This for Buda!&rdquo; &ldquo;This for
Belgrade!&rdquo; they gave no quarter, and scorned the
highest ransoms offered in order to take vengeance
on their ancient enemies.</p>
<p>It was only nightfall which ended this bloody
battle. Twenty thousand Turks lay dead or wounded
on the field, ten thousand had found death in the
wild waters of the Theiss. Barely a thousand had
fled to the opposite shore, whence the Sultan watched
the destruction of the faithful; the tragic end of his
hopes. In the fear that his retreat toward Temesvar
might be cut off by the Austrian troops, he rode
away in the night on a fleet steed, accompanied by
only a small band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Messengers of victory hurried to Vienna. In his
report to the Emperor, Eugene picturesquely said:
&ldquo;Even the sun would not set, until it had seen the
complete triumph of the imperial arms.&rdquo; And the
great general added: &ldquo;Next to God&rsquo;s help, the victory
at Zenta is to be ascribed to the heroic spirit of the
leaders and soldiers.&rdquo; This modest soldier said not
a word about himself and yet he had been the soul
of it all. His military keenness, the boldness of his
decisions, and not least of all, the energy with which
he had carried out his plans on this day&mdash;which
will always be a glorious one in Austrian annals&mdash;redound
to his highest fame.</p>
<p>Eugene&rsquo;s fame spread on the wings of the wind
over the whole of Germany and of Europe. He was
classed with the greatest generals and even his
enemies said, &ldquo;This has been a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What must King Louis the Fourteenth and Louvois
have thought of this? Perhaps they may have
had a presentiment that some day France herself
might be in his power.</p>
<p>The following day Eugene led the victorious army
into the deserted camp of the Sultan. Here they
discovered treasures beyond belief. Besides three
million piastres in the war chest, they found an
immense quantity of all kinds of weapons, all the
ammunition and baggage, whole herds of camels,
oxen, and sheep, and a great number of flags, horsetails,
standards, and other trophies of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Such a victory as this at Zenta had never been
won by Christians over unbelievers, and the heathen
had never before suffered such a terrible defeat. It
was now necessary to follow up the victory and to
gather the fruits of it. The way in which Eugene
contrived to do this in spite of many drawbacks and
hindrances serves but to add another glorious leaf
to his victor&rsquo;s wreath. In short, in a single campaign
he had reconquered Siebenb&uuml;rgen, Hungary as far
as Temesvar, also Banat and Slavonia as far as
Belgrade for his Emperor.</p>
<p>At the end of November Eugene returned to
Vienna. The Emperor received him with every
mark of favor and gratitude, and presented him with a
sword richly set with precious stones. The populace
enthusiastically greeted the famous conqueror of the
Turks. He who had already so often repulsed the infidels
had now exceeded their wildest hopes. Eugene
became the people&rsquo;s hero and ever remained so.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth of January, 1699, peace was
declared between the Emperor and the Porte, after
seventy-two days of negotiations at Carlovitz, a
little town near Peterwardein. This consummation,
ardently desired by conquerors and conquered,
had been brought about by Eugene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The time of peace was taken advantage of by the
Prince to found a home for himself in Vienna. This
had long been his secret wish so that he could live
quietly and devote himself to scientific study, for
which he was more and more inclined. The house
which he bought stood in the street called &ldquo;Gate of
Heaven,&rdquo; in the same place where later he built his
new palace Belvedere, at present the seat of the
Ministry of Finance. The Emperor also presented
him with important estates in Hungary, and the
Prince bought others for a mere song. There were
now great hopes for an extended period of peace.
The sound of arms had died away in the West as
well as in the East, and even the mischief-maker,
King Louis the Fourteenth, was eager to bequeath to
his people the memory of a peace-loving ruler. The
world drew a long breath, but alas&mdash;all too soon,
to be again plunged into fresh disorders and new
alarms of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">War of the Spanish Succession</span></h2>
<p>King Charles the Second of Spain
died on the first of November, 1700, without
leaving a natural heir to the throne. He
was the last Hapsburg of the older line, and so they
flattered themselves at the castle in Vienna that
they could take this rich inheritance as a natural
right. A sad disappointment awaited them. Charles
the Second had, at the last moment, made a will in
favor of France, appointing the grandson of the
King, Duke Philip of Anjou, sole heir. It was very
evident how this had been accomplished. Louis
the Fourteenth had schemed and intrigued to get
this rich inheritance for his family, and King Charles
the Second of Spain was a weak character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When the news reached Vienna it caused the
greatest consternation, not only at court, but among
all classes of the population. The people rioted in
the streets of the capital; the ministers demanded
that the Emperor should suppress the disorder; and
the Crown Prince, Joseph the First, an active and
passionate young man, went so far as to send for
the French minister, the Marquis de Villars, and to
denounce this proceeding of his master as underhanded
and deceitful.</p>
<p>It was not to be wondered at that war soon broke
out; the bloody War of the Spanish Succession, which
lasted from 1700 to 1714, humbled, indeed, the arrogant
Louis, and also inflicted great harm upon Germany.
It is remarkable that one hundred and
seventy years later the throne of Spain was again
the bone of contention, and that it was again a French
sovereign who was most concerned in the affair.
This later ruler was chastised much more promptly
and more thoroughly than his ancestor.</p>
<p>Crafty Louis the Fourteenth understood how to
gain allies rapidly. These were the hypocritical
Elector of Cologne, the Duke of Savoy, and unfortunately
also the German Emperor&rsquo;s own son-in-law,
the warlike and fiery Elector, Max Emanuel
of Bavaria, the conqueror of Belgrade. They were
all seduced by the vain promises of the French King
that a crumb from the French inheritance should
fall to them, and they lent a hand to the false ruler
on the Seine, to war against the imperial house.
The Emperor, on the other hand, stood quite alone,
an almost pathetic figure in the great drama about
to be enacted, but resolved from the bottom of his
heart to risk everything in support of his rights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The French were more enterprising than the Germans.
While the recruiting drum was still heard
in the crown-lands of Austria and warlike bands were
still streaming in from all sides, not forgetting the
imperial troops grown gray in the service and fresh
from the Turkish wars, the French had already
entered Italy in order to occupy the Spanish possessions
in the spirit of the old adage, &ldquo;Possession is
nine points of the law.&rdquo; Starhemberg mobilized
the imperial army in the Tyrol. It was a matter of
course that the Field-Marshal Prince Eugene of
Savoy should command it. Associated with him
were two experienced French soldiers, two brothers-in-arms,
the Prince de Commercy and the Prince
de Vaudemont.</p>
<p>With thirty thousand men, &ldquo;amongst them not
one coward,&rdquo; as Eugene assured the Austrian Crown-Prince
Joseph, Starhemberg and B&ouml;rner advanced
into Italy. On the twentieth of May, 1701, Eugene
joined them at Roveredo. The French were commanded
by Marshal Catinat&mdash;Eugene had once
before, as we know, met him face to face in Italy.
Catinat had made good use of his time and occupied
all the mountain passes which led out of the Tyrol
into Italy. The republic of Venice then held the
eastern half of upper Italy. Under these circumstances
many of the bravest and best heads in the
army were very dubious about attacking the French.
But Eugene was willing to take the responsibility;
for such emergencies, he thought, the Emperor had
made him a field-marshal. He was in very good
spirits. Now the time had come to strike a blow at
the French and especially at King Louis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>How different was his present position in Italy
compared with that which he had occupied during
his first campaign! He was now completely independent.
The vain and crafty Catinat must be shown
what he had learned, and he must uphold the glory
of the German arms for the discomfiture of Louis.
He must enter Italy, that was certain; and he knew
how thoroughly Catinat had intrenched himself.
Eugene quickly made up his mind; he absolutely
must attack him; he had not studied the tactics of
the great Carthaginian, Hannibal, for nothing. Like
him, he chose a passage over the Alps. For this
enterprise alone, had he fought no other battles,
nor rendered any other service to the Emperor and
the country, Eugene would have gained immortal
renown. All the more so, as at that time many
of the facilities were entirely lacking which would
now be at the service of a general.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>And how did he accomplish this daring feat?
Thousands of soldiers and inhabitants of the surrounding
country were kept busy early and late
making a passageway for the troops over the steep
mountain paths. Here a shoulder of rock was
broken away with shovels, pickaxes, and crowbars;
there a steep declivity was graded; at another place
a dam was made out of great logs, or a bridge was
built over a gorge. Withal Eugene&rsquo;s greatest task
was to keep Catinat in ignorance of the road which he
was preparing, although the Frenchman could scarcely
dream of the possibility of such a surprise. He kept
General von Guttenstein constantly before the French
army so that Catinat should think that Eugene&rsquo;s
position was just behind the General&rsquo;s vanguard.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of May 26 the march began,
which was to equal the most celebrated feats of this
kind in ancient as well as modern times, and indeed
to surpass most of them. The army advanced in
two sections and by two different roads. The
dragoons who were delegated to accompany the
infantry had to dismount and lead their horses by
the bridles. The cannon were hoisted with ropes,
and the wagons were taken apart and carried.
Arrived at the top, the cannon were drawn by oxen,
while soldiers and peasants walked beside them to
keep them from sliding off the paths or to lend a
hand where the road was steep. In places where a
cart had never crossed these inaccessible mountains,
a whole army now found passage. In the best of
spirits the soldiers moved forward, delighted with
this silent and beautiful world, past dizzy precipices
and yawning depths, through virgin forests
and rough moraines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>By the fourth of June, Eugene with the whole
Austrian army had achieved the &ldquo;surmounted impossibility&rdquo;
as he jokingly called this daring alpine
march, and Catinat was greatly astonished to see
him appear before him with his 30,000 men. He was
already half beaten, for with the enemy so close at
hand, he could not make up his mind which plan to
choose. He spread his troops along the river Etsch,
fatigued them with constant marching and countermarching,
expected an attack first in this quarter,
then in that, and did not know what to do&mdash;quite
a contrast to Eugene, who had long ago made up
his mind what course to take.</p>
<p>At last the decisive moment came. In the night,
between the eighth and ninth of July, Eugene crossed
the Tartaro with 11,000 men and made a sharp
attack upon the enemy intrenched at Castagnaro.
The Austrians fought like lions. It was not long
before the place was taken and the French expelled.
From there, Eugene marched his whole force against
the town of Carpi. He met indeed with great difficulties
in this territory, which was intersected by
canals, morasses, ricefields, and brush, but he managed
to overcome them all. The armies were soon
to measure their strength once more. One side
fought as bravely as the other. Eugene&rsquo;s horse was
shot under him, and he received a slight wound, in
spite of which he led his troops on to victory at
Carpi. Inspired by his previous successes, he developed
an enterprise, a daring of conception, and a
facility in carrying out his plans, which made this
one of his most brilliant campaigns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>On the twenty-seventh of July he crossed the
Mincio, to Catinat&rsquo;s great alarm. After this movement
Catinat had but one thought, to reach the
Oglio, where, covered by this river, he might prevent
the Austrians from entering Milanese territory.
On this retreat the French proved themselves true
barbarians. They laid waste the country wherever
they could, burned and plundered shamelessly, but
in revenge many of these robbers were shot down
by the embittered peasantry. The Austrian soldiers
who followed them were greeted as deliverers from
the French yoke.</p>
<p>In Paris there was great consternation over the
misfortunes of Marshal Catinat. Proud King Louis
had counted on victory and here was nothing but
Job&rsquo;s comfort. But what provoked him most was
the fact that it was the little <i>abb&eacute;</i> with the disagreeable
face who had gained these victories over his
troops. To mend the situation and ensure success
for the future, after recalling Catinat, the King&rsquo;s
former playmate and intimate friend, Marshal
Villeroi, was intrusted with the command of the
army in Italy. He boasted that he would soon
drive Eugene back into the Tyrolese mountains,
and promised the Parisians that he would teach
three Princes (Eugene, Commercy, and Vaudemont)
to dance to his piping, and even that he would send
them back prisoners to the French capital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>In the beginning he really seemed formidable, for
he brought fresh troops to Italy, so that he outnumbered
the Austrians, two to one. His first move was
to reoccupy the left bank of the Oglio. Prince
Eugene had good reasons for not interfering, which
Villeroi with truly comic shortsightedness characterized
as &ldquo;a sign of weakness and fear.&rdquo; But
Eugene understood very well what he was doing
and what remained to be done. He now took up
an excellent position with his troops facing in three
directions, placed his cannon in a masterly manner,
and thought to himself: &ldquo;If you want anything of
me, I am ready for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>And they came. It was on the first of September,
1701, at the little town of Chiari. With the greatest
ease the Austrian outposts were carried and, with
the fiery impetuosity which is peculiar to the French
in a first assault, they advanced against Eugene&rsquo;s
intrenchments. To their great surprise they saw
scarcely a man, for Eugene had ordered his soldiers
to lie down behind their redoubts and not to fire
until the enemy were within fifty feet. Many a
brave soldier&rsquo;s fingers, as he watched the advance
of the French, may have itched to pull the trigger
while they were still at a distance. But their beloved
General had given the order and they never
moved an eyelash! Suddenly the fire burst forth
from all sides, and whole columns of the French were
mowed down. Again the second and third ranks
fired and the cannon fell in line with volleys of grapeshot.
That was indeed a surprise. It was an awful
massacre.</p>
<p>Marshal Villeroi was so disconcerted by this beginning
that he did not know what to do next. He
issued no orders and left his army unprotected under
the adversaries&rsquo; constant fire. It was his corps-commanders,
Catinat and Duke Victor Amadeus of
Savoy, who arranged for the retreat of the army.
Eugene did not remain passive, but drove the enemy
out of every position, replacing them with his own
men. At Chiari sixty thousand Frenchmen were
vanquished by twenty-five thousand Germans. The
enemy suffered a loss of over two thousand men,
among them two hundred officers, while the Austrian
army counted only thirty-six dead and eighty-one
wounded. This was a cheap victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>But besides their armed enemy the French had
another enemy in the peasants of Lombardy. The
country favored the Germans more each day. Every
night wagon-loads of provisions were voluntarily
sent to them, while the French began to suffer hunger
and want. Added to this came continuous showers
of rain, making impassable roads. In a few words
Villeroi described the condition of the army to the
King: &ldquo;To remain here longer would be to ruin
our fine cavalry.&rdquo; Thus quickly had the boastful
Marshal changed his opinions and forgotten utterly
his promise to teach the three princes to dance.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth of November the French retired
once more across the Oglio. Eugene&rsquo;s batteries
assisted them in a most unwelcome manner. He
then sent out patrolling parties, who continually
harassed them, giving them no time to take breath.
He took Caneto from them and drove them out of
the whole Mantuan territory. The city itself was
still occupied by the French, but they could take no
comfort in it, for Prince Eugene had it well blockaded
and watched night and day. Eugene showed such
tireless energy that it seemed as though he were
just beginning the campaign instead of having
already brought it to a glorious conclusion, thereby
augmenting the power of the imperial house and
gaining the affection and sympathy of the people.
Now, one sovereign after another began to reflect
that it might be better for his own interests if the
Emperor, instead of Louis the Fourteenth of France,
held the balance of power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The first to decide in favor of the Emperor was
the new King of Prussia, Frederick the First. He
promised the Emperor to furnish an army of ten
thousand men. Then came Denmark contributing
six thousand men. Hanover also did not hold back.
Still more important was it that England and Holland
declared for the Emperor, of course in their
own interests; for while France had the ascendancy
they feared for their commerce with Spain and the
East and West Indies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Duke Victor Amadeus earned scant
thanks in Turin for the help he had given. Though
he had fought bravely at Chiari and had led his
soldiers into the thick of the fight, yet he was under
suspicion in Paris. All the misfortunes in Italy
were attributed to him, and they would have been
glad to put all the burden of failure on his shoulders.
This the faithless Savoy saw full well, but did not
consider it the proper time to draw his threatened
head out of the French noose, and he did not have
the courage to declare openly for the Emperor.</p>
<p>Marshal Villeroi spent the winter in Cremona living
care-free a life of pleasure and luxury. The three
princes had long since heard of his promise to make
them dance in Paris. They may have thought that
it would be a good idea to make him dance in Vienna.
These were amusing thoughts to while away the
dreary hours of camp life, but were at first vague and
without definite purpose. They would have liked
best to take the whole nest, Cremona, with its rare
bird. But just now there was no time; and besides
this, all the means for a complete siege were lacking,
although the desire for it grew greater from day to
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>One of the three, Prince Commercy, was a cunning
fellow; when he had made up his mind to a thing it
was not easy to dissuade him. He was the one who
had been most annoyed by Villeroi&rsquo;s promise to the
Parisians. He now concocted a plot, splendid in
its way, which I shall describe to you. Field-Marshal
Prince Commercy was already acquainted in
Cremona from earlier times. A priest who lived
there had been a companion of his student days at
the University. They exchanged confidential letters,
and one word led to another. Through this priest
(Antonio Cosoli was his name) he learned casually
that an old empty canal, which had been unnoticed
by the French forces, intersected the fortifications
and was connected with the cellar of the house
owned by Father Cosoli. This fell in nicely with
Commercy&rsquo;s plan. He immediately communicated
the discovery to Prince Eugene, who took this opportunity
of introducing his soldiers into the town, so
that he might perhaps gain possession of it. He
knew that the gates were not well guarded, and that
there were even no sentries on the walls; all of which
favored his undertaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>On a pitch dark January night, whose terrors
were augmented by a storm of wind and rain, the
troops which Eugene had selected for this surprise
broke camp. There were grenadiers, cuirassiers,
and hussars, altogether about four thousand men.
Another somewhat smaller band was guided along
the Po by Prince Vaudemont, to take the bridge
by storm and enter the town by way of the river.
Eugene, Commercy, and Starhemberg rode on ahead
of their troops to a house about two thousand yards
from Cremona. The troops should have arrived
there at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but were delayed
until about five o&rsquo;clock by the heavy rains and muddy
roads. Major Hofman of the Geschwind regiment,
led by a trusty guide, stole with his grenadiers
through the long canal scarcely two feet broad,
which had until this time served only as a refuge
for the rats. He had orders to remain concealed in
the priest&rsquo;s house until Colonel Count Nasary of
the Lorraine regiment and Lieutenant-Colonel Count
Knefstein of the Hebenstein regiment could likewise
penetrate into the town by the same means. Hofman
was to overcome the guard at the Margaret
Gate as quietly as possible, to open the gate, and
then by means of three columns of fire on the walls,
to give the signal for the advance of the troops outside.
Lieutenant-Colonel Count Mercy was commanded
then to enter the city, gallop to the Po
Gate, and open it for Vaudemont.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The plan succeeded perfectly. The French guard
was overcome and the gate opened. In full gallop
with drawn sabres the German cavalry dashed
through the streets to the appointed places. The
infantry took the important posts, and Eugene with
his staff betook himself to the court-house, to direct
the further movements of the troops from there.
There was but one more thing to do: it was necessary
to hold themselves on the defensive until Prince
Vaudemont had surprised the bridge, to throw open
the gates for him, and then with united forces to
compel the enemy to surrender or to annihilate them.</p>
<p>Marshal Villeroi had returned in the evening from
Milan, where he had doubtless eaten and drunk
well, and he was now sleeping like a dormouse. It
was not until seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning that a
few musket shots were heard near his quarters.
Drunk with sleep, the Frenchman turned over in
bed. A lackey broke into his room with the terrible
cry, &ldquo;The Germans are in the city!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>You should have seen the Marshal jump up then!
He was in great haste! He quickly threw on some
clothes and sprang upon his horse. Too late! At
that moment German soldiers saw him and pulled
him down. They squabbled over him, for they suspected
a lucky catch and each wanted to claim him.
Just then an officer, the Irishman MacDonald, threw
himself upon the struggling soldiers and freed Villeroi
from his painful predicament. The Marshal offered
him ten thousand pistoles and a regiment in the French
army, if he would allow him to escape. Now for the
first time the Irishman perceived what a rare bird he
had in his snare, but the loyal fellow refused these
brilliant offers and led his captive to headquarters.</p>
<p>Starhemberg recognized Villeroi immediately, received
his sword, and then sent him to Prince Eugene.
In spite of the seriousness of the situation it must
have been a merry meeting. The spectacular drama
&ldquo;three dancing princes&rdquo; had come to naught, and
the Parisians would have to forego this promised
pleasure. Instead Marshal Villeroi was marched
away to Ustiano.</p>
<p>In the meantime the shooting, drumming, and
shouting in Cremona had grown so loud that the
French realized what had happened. One of their
officers, who was just about to lead his battalion
to the parade ground, threw himself heroically on
the Germans and so gave his countrymen time to
assemble. In spite of this, they would have been
conquered if Prince Vaudemont had arrived from
the Po Gate, which Count Mercy had opened for
him. But here a very desperate fight had taken
place. Two Irish regiments in the French service
had attacked brave Mercy, taken him prisoner, and
burned the bridge over the Po, thus preventing
Vaudemont from crossing the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The French had now retired into the houses and
from thence kept up a well-directed fire on the
Austrians. Hour after hour the battle wavered;
the Austrians began to run short of ammunition.
Besides this, Eugene was afraid of being cut off
from his line of retreat by General Crequi, who was
probably marching toward Cremona. Therefore at
five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, as twilight began to
fall, he gave orders to evacuate the city. He took
with him as prisoners nineteen officers, four hundred
soldiers, seven standards, and five hundred horses.
Besides this, the French lost twelve hundred dead
and wounded in the streets of the city, while the
Emperor&rsquo;s troops lost only six hundred. Marshal
de Villeroi was taken to Graz, where he was held
for nine months and well treated, then exchanged
without any ransom for a Count Waldstein, who had
been taken by the French at Carpi. The French
proclaimed Eugene&rsquo;s retreat from Cremona as a
victory for themselves and composed couplets in
which they congratulated themselves on having held
Cremona and having lost Villeroi.</p>
<p>The French King now appointed Duke Louis of
Vend&ocirc;me in Villeroi&rsquo;s place. Louis and Eugene had
formerly been playmates. Both had had an honorable
career and were now to play at the terrible
game of war as opponents. They appreciated one
another&rsquo;s talents also; at least Eugene frankly said
that Vend&ocirc;me was a formidable antagonist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>But the game was now quite a different one.
Vend&ocirc;me&rsquo;s army, through new accessions, numbered
nearly eighty thousand; Eugene had, as before, his
thirty thousand. How was it possible to achieve
success, as Vend&ocirc;me was constantly on the alert
and was determined to make good the mistakes of
his predecessors, Catinat and Villeroi? Besides this,
Eugene&rsquo;s army began to need money, arms, and
clothing. The Council-of-War in Vienna replied to
his urgent demands only with embarrassed shrugs.
The old president of the council, Ehren-Starhemberg,
had passed away, and the other gentlemen were
perhaps not so well disposed toward the young
Field-Marshal, who had been promoted so rapidly.
Therefore it was all the more necessary that Eugene
should keep cool and take every possible precaution.
But one must have the means to execute as well as
the brain to plan, in order to be successful. And
the means were now sadly lacking, so that Eugene
was obliged to keep very quiet and avoid an engagement
for the present, that the enemy might not have
an opportunity of destroying him; for the Frenchman
was very anxious to distinguish himself by a
brilliant coup. And now Eugene conceived a clever
plan. Should it succeed, it would be something to
capture Vend&ocirc;me, even if he could not cripple his
army. Through a loyal Piedmontese, Eugene had
learned that Vend&ocirc;me occupied a house which stood
quite alone on the Lake of Mantua. It should be an
easy task to approach by water, to surprise the Marshal
and carry him off in a boat to the opposite shore
into Eugene&rsquo;s camp. He lost no time in carrying
out this enterprise. On a mild June night twelve
boats carrying two hundred picked men under Marquis
Daria were launched. They moved cautiously
and silently forward. On arriving, Daria disembarked
with a few soldiers and called out to the sentry
that he had brought some sick Frenchmen from
Mantua. Instead of beating down the sentry, as
had been commanded, one of the soldiers with
unpardonable zeal fired upon him, and the comrades
who had remained behind in the boats also began
firing. This made such a terrific uproar that Daria
thought it best to retire as quickly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Thus unfortunately, this attempt, which with a
little more caution might have turned out so well,
failed. Eugene was highly indignant, caused a
rigid investigation to be made, and the guilty ones
were well punished. Vend&ocirc;me was so angry at the
attempt to take him prisoner and send him to
Vienna that he shelled the Austrian camp, but could
not prevent Eugene from taking his revenge by surrounding
Mantua with redoubts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Soon after these events Eugene&rsquo;s army suffered
a hard blow, due likewise to the great carelessness
of the higher officers. Austrian cavalry had driven
back the enemy to the Crostolo. At Santa Vittoria
they took up a position which, on reconnoitring,
Eugene found to be very insecure. He turned over
the command of the cavalry to the master of ammunition,
Count Auersperg, although he seemed to have
a premonition of disaster. Auersperg conducted
the affair with the most unpardonable carelessness,
placed no sentries, and neglected every precaution.
Of course disaster followed. Vend&ocirc;me took him by
surprise, and so sudden and unexpected was the
attack that the men did not even have time to seize
their horses and mount. Now, too late, Auersperg
sought to repair his mistakes. He rallied his soldiers
about him and, scorning death, placed himself at
their head and managed to drive the enemy back,
and even to take some standards from them. The
French infantry, however, advanced and commenced
a murderous musketry fire, which the cavalry was
not long able to endure. They turned for flight.
Many tried to swim the Tassone, but were carried
away by the current or found death on its marshy
banks. A wild charge of the dragoon regiment,
Herbeville, then drove back the enemy and rescued
the scattered and fleeing comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, Eugene learned
of the unfortunate occurrence. He immediately
took all precautions to prevent the enemy from
making any further advance. Indeed he soon did
still more: he retrieved this disaster by the battle
at Luzzara on the Po, on the first of August, 1702.
At that place Vend&ocirc;me occupied an excellent position
protected by dams, moats, and barricades. The
battle did not begin until nearly five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon. Twenty-four thousand Germans were
opposed to fifty-three thousand Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Eugene&rsquo;s army was divided into two columns, one
of them led by Starhemberg, the other by Field-Marshal
Prince de Commercy. The latter opened
the battle. His soldiers threw themselves upon the
enemy from a dam, behind which they had been concealed,
and were received with a terrible hail of shot.
On horseback, within sight of all his men, Commercy
remained in the thick of the fight. Suddenly&mdash;hit
by two balls at once&mdash;the hero fell from his horse,
dead. His men hesitated and gave way. This
made a dangerous breach. But Eugene&rsquo;s keen eye
guided the battle. Two imperial regiments and
the Danes hurried up to their support. Backward
and forward surged the battle. Success seemed out
of the question. Then Eugene himself came dashing
up. With that bold disregard of death which
was characteristic of the hero, he put himself at the
head of his men and led them forward once more.
In a solid column the battalions advanced. Nothing
could restrain their heroic ardor. They climbed the
dike and threw the enemy back on their camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>On the left wing of the imperial army, commanded
by Starhemberg, the fighting was even more bitter.
Opposed to him was the flower of the French troops
under Vend&ocirc;me&rsquo;s own leadership. With impetuous
courage Starhemberg pushed forward. Nothing
could withstand him. He drove the enemy before
him in a rout. It seemed as though they were
becoming demoralized; the French retreat looked
like flight. In the zeal of the pursuit a wide gap
was made in the ranks of the Austrians. As Eugene
had done, Vend&ocirc;me now recognized the great danger
to his right wing. He formed, from the reserves
and several other regiments, a tremendous storming
column, which he hurriedly threw upon the Starhemberg
troops, who were already drunk with victory.
He broke through their front ranks and forced the
whole wing into a hurried retreat. Disaster was
imminent and only timely and effective assistance
could save the day. At the decisive moment Prince
Vaudemont came rattling up with his heavy cavalry.
This successful attack gave Starhemberg time to
re-form his regiments and to push on to a renewed
assault. This took place with great effect, supported
by the well-aimed fire of B&ouml;rner&rsquo;s artillery. Although
the French did their best to hold their ground&mdash;53,000
against 24,000&mdash;it was of no use, they were
obliged to retire into their protected camp. Eugene&rsquo;s
plan was to storm this immediately and drive out
the French. But his regiments were so exhausted
that the setting sun counselled both struggling parties
to take a much needed rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The day at Luzzara placed a new leaf in Eugene&rsquo;s
victor&rsquo;s wreath, although Vend&ocirc;me and later prejudiced
historians would like so well to dispute this.
The French celebrated the day as a victory, fired
salutes and caused the bells to be rung in Cremona
and Milan. In his quiet fashion Eugene comments
upon this: &ldquo;One should allow them to shout a little,
as the innkeeper does his guests when they have
settled their accounts.&rdquo; This comment of the
General passed from mouth to mouth and described
the situation perfectly. The fact was, however,
that it was the Austrians who held possession of the
battle-field, and even on the next day and the following
ones Vend&ocirc;me contented himself with sending
a cannon ball now and then among the Austrians.
If he was not badly beaten at Luzzara, why did he
not again attack Eugene and his handful of men?
Why did he not follow up his victory?</p>
<p>For the present no new enterprises were undertaken
in Italy. The Frenchmen lacked courage and
the Austrians the money for them. In Eugene&rsquo;s own
words: the want of everything was much greater than
he could describe or one could believe who had not
himself seen it; and in the war office in Vienna there
were words but no funds, which are the sinews of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Blenheim</span></h2>
<p>In the year 1703 Prince Eugene was appointed
President of the Royal Council of War in
Vienna, a position which placed him at the
head of all military affairs. This was a very happy
choice. Eugene was just the man to bring order
into affairs and to act with decision. Things were
at loose ends, as the reader may have noticed. In
accepting this high honor from the Emperor, Eugene
had made but one condition; namely, that he should
be strongly supported in all his measures for the good
of the service and the army. A field was now opened
to him where his keenness and insight found their
proper activities. The troops rejoiced greatly at
the promotion of their beloved leader. They forgot
the trials they had suffered, and hoped for better
days. They believed that, now, at least they would
not be obliged to suffer for necessities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The Emperor was in dire need of a competent
minister of war; of a brain which could plan for all.
Within a short time the condition of European
affairs had changed completely, and though the
Emperor&rsquo;s cause was greatly helped by the recent
acquisition of powerful allies, still there were so
many complicated threads that it would take a
very clever hand to untangle them, to organize the
different divisions of the army, and to guide and
hold them ready for prompt and decisive action.
That this would not be an easy task was self-evident.
Prince Eugene, like all mortals, had his enemies and
detractors. His energetic methods did not please
everyone, especially those in higher circles, who had
heretofore been indifferent and passive. The situation
must have caused him many a headache.
But there was one thing that supported him; namely,
devotion to his Emperor and his righteous cause, to
promote which he tirelessly considered new plans
and means which involved many little vexations
and mortifications. &ldquo;Patience! patience! patience!&rdquo;
he often said to himself. He generally proposed
the opposite of that which he really intended, knowing
beforehand that his suggestion would be rejected
and that the measure which he himself really wanted
would be recommended. It was a remarkable and
dangerous game which his colleagues were playing
while the glorious continuation or the shameful
downfall of the German imperial house hung in the
balance!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>As we already know, England and Holland had
taken sides with the hard-pressed German Emperor
and had placed a strong army in the Netherlands.
Their commander was the gifted English General
Marlborough, who had already met the French several
times and had shown them that he knew how
to conduct a war and understood the arts of attack
and defence equally well. With a second army Margrave
Louis of Baden stood guard over the Rhine
in the neighborhood of his home, and the Prussian
allies were also on hand under the leadership of the
daring Prince Leopold of Dessau. Unfortunately
the Elector Max Emanuel of Bavaria was still on
the French side. Guided by petty self-interest, he
had deserted and betrayed his German fatherland.</p>
<p>Besides the French and Bavarians, the Turks
and Hungarians were bestirring themselves once
more. This was a prearranged scheme in which
France again had her hand, for she was anxious to
attack Austria from all sides. But the outcome
was very different from what the Emperor&rsquo;s enemies
had expected. We shall see what happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The two generals, Marlborough and Eugene, were
placed first in command. For a long time they had
been mutual admirers. They were attracted to
one another, for, as the maxim says: like seeks like.
Eugene, who was thoroughly German in feeling, was
deeply pained to know that the French were in Germany&mdash;that
is, in Bavaria. Had he had the power
he would soon have turned them out. He now
devised a plan by means of which, with the aid of
the English, he might accomplish this. It may be
admitted that there had been a great deal of correspondence
in regard to the matter, but when it had
been thoroughly considered in all its details it was
remarkable how well the plans of the two generals
coincided.</p>
<p>Eugene and Marlborough&rsquo;s plan in brief was,
to unite their forces in Bavaria, to call also upon
Margrave Louis of Baden, and then to strike a sudden
blow. For the present Prince Eugene temporarily
resigned his office of President of the Council of
War, donned his modest soldier&rsquo;s coat, and girded
on his sword. As the direct road was occupied by
the Bavarians and French&mdash;the latter under Marshal
Marsin&mdash;he hurried to the seat of war by the
roundabout way of the Tyrol and Vorarlberg. His
arrival was greeted with loud rejoicings by the army.
Those princes who were allied in opposition to
the imperial house felt that his appearance was the
forerunner of important events. For instance, the
Elector of Bavaria wrote to the King of France:
&ldquo;It is not to be doubted that the Prince of Savoy
visits the seat of war in order to carry out great
projects.&rdquo; It was plain that his opponents feared
the noble knight. Had Margrave Louis of Baden
been as resolute as of old, it would certainly have
been an easy task for him to make the Elector of
Bavaria, who was just now separated from Marsin,
feel the sharpness of his sword. As it was, he pursued
him but tardily and confronted him at last at Ehingen,
near Ulm, where the Elector was encamped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It was at this time that Eugene rejoined the
army. He could probably not avoid reproaching
the Margrave, though this must have been a very
unpleasant task, for he was much indebted to him;
but the service could not be allowed to suffer through
friendship. However, all might yet be well. Marlborough
was on the way to southern Germany with
his army, consisting of picked troops, excellently
clothed and armed. He had sent word to Eugene
that he would conquer or die with him.</p>
<p>On the tenth of June, 1704, Eugene and Marlborough
met for the first time at Mundelsheim.
They made the most agreeable impression upon one
another. A confidential intercourse developed and
a mutual desire to accommodate one another in all
points, which soon showed its happy effects on the
soldiers of both armies.</p>
<p>Three days later they joined the Margrave of
Baden at Grossheppach. To this day, at the inn
&ldquo;Zum Lamm&rdquo; (&ldquo;at the sign of the Lamb&rdquo;), the tree
is shown beneath which the three generals held a
council of war. The resolution was taken to lure
the enemy, now in southern Bavaria, across the
Danube in order to destroy him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The Margrave, as the higher in rank, insisted on
taking command of the imperial troops and co&ouml;perating
with Marlborough on the Danube. In order
not to disturb the good understanding, Eugene subordinated
himself and took command of the troops on
the Rhine. This was a very important post, for it
was necessary to prevent the union of the French
marshals, Tallart and Villeroi, an attempt which
Eugene from the first considered scarcely possible.</p>
<p>In increasing numbers the French pressed forward
across the Rhine. They meant to give Germany
her death-blow. Eugene&rsquo;s plan was to detain Villeroi
on the Rhine, on his way from the Netherlands.
In the meantime Marlborough and Louis of Baden
had not been idle; the Bavarian Field-Marshal
Arco, who with eight thousand men had attempted
to dispute their passage of the Danube, had been
crushed at the Schottenberg. As a result of this,
the Elector retired to Augsburg. Under cover of
its cannon he felt himself secure. The allies followed
at his heels, but without attempting anything.</p>
<p>Efforts were again made toward peace, and an
attempt was made to reconcile the Elector with his
father-in-law, the Emperor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>All was in vain. The Elector, in his boundless
ambition, planned first to tear the German Empire
asunder and then to appropriate the lion&rsquo;s share.
He again had visions of the crown of France, or
indeed the German imperial crown, upon his head;
he was, in short, a cheap creature of the &ldquo;Most
Christian&rdquo; King of France, and would hear nothing
of reconciliation. He did his utmost to hasten the
advance of Marshal Tallart. War alone should
decide his fate.</p>
<p>Tallart appeared, but close after him followed
Eugene, whom Villeroi believed to be still at the
Stollhof frontier. On the third of August the
Prince was at H&ouml;chst&auml;dt, going into camp there and
joining Marlborough a few days later. Margrave
Louis of Baden had in the meantime undertaken
the siege of Ingolstadt, so that his indecision could
no longer be a hindrance.</p>
<p>Haste was now necessary; not a moment must
be lost. Both great generals agreed that the decisive
battle must be fought on the narrow plain
between Blenheim and H&ouml;chst&auml;dt. To this end the
enemy were allowed to cross the Danube quietly
and establish themselves at H&ouml;chst&auml;dt. The Bavarians
and French had no real knowledge of the true
state of affairs. They intended to attack Eugene,
whom they believed to be separated from Marlborough,
and they expected to overcome him without
much difficulty. Too late they learned their mistake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>From the church tower at Tapfheim Marlborough
and Eugene observed the advance and man&oelig;uvres
of the enemy. They posted themselves on the
opposite side of the Nebelbach. The right wing
rested on Blenheim on the Danube, where Tallart
took up his quarters. The left wing, under Marsin,
was supported by the village of Lutzingen and the
slopes of the Goldberg. The Nebelbach was in front
of them. The Elector with his cavalry was situated
at Sonderheim, a short distance from Blenheim. The
allies were behind the Kesselbach. Marlborough,
who commanded the left wing, was at M&uuml;nster on
the Danube; Eugene, with the right, at Oppertshofen.
Thus dawned the twelfth of August of the year 1704,
the day which was to decide the power of German
strength over French force and cunning.</p>
<p>As early as three o&rsquo;clock in the morning the roll
of drums and trumpet calls awakened the allies to
the bloody harvest work of this hot August day.
The moon was setting and threw its last pale light
over the landscape. A thick fog covered the great
plain and hid the distance. Each of the allies&rsquo;
armies was divided into four columns, of which two
consisted of infantry and two of cavalry. The infantry
marched in front, the cavalry behind, and
the artillery was in the middle. A ninth column
was formed to cover the march of the English and
Dutch artillery, then to attack Blenheim and from
thence to fall upon the enemy&rsquo;s right flank. The
Prussian reserve corps, under the young Prince
Leopold of Dessau, was attached to Eugene&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The fog lifted; it was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock when the
enemy became visible. They were still under the
strange delusion that the allies would not dare to
attack them, but would retire toward N&ouml;rdlingen.
But all at once they were surprised by a sudden onslaught.
The Bavarian outposts were quickly overcome;
the battle broke out here and there in jets
of flame. In order to hold Blenheim, Tallart made
the mistake of withdrawing twenty-seven battalions
from his centre, where Clerambault commanded.
The narrow strip between the village and the Danube
was protected by a barricade of wagons, behind which
stood four regiments of unmounted dragoons ready
to defend it. The French line of battle was spread
out for miles. It surged back and forth like the ebb
and flow of the sea.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning Tallart&rsquo;s artillery
opened a murderous fire on the allies, who, of course,
answered in kind. Eugene&rsquo;s regiments, particularly,
suffered under this fierce cannonading. Coming up
from a hollow, their left flank was in line of the firing,
but in spite of this they hastily threw five bridges
across the Nebelbach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Toward noon Marlborough mounted his horse
and gave the signal for the attack. Lord Cutts
proceeded with his men, at the signal for a general
advance, toward the mills of Blenheim, and took
them. At the same time the English cavalry crossed
the Nebelbach. Immediately they were engaged
in a hand to hand struggle with the French. There
were mighty blows of the sword on helmet and
armor; the squadrons plunged wildly upon one
another. Unfortunately the English cavalry was
the weaker. Pursued by the French they fell back
on the infantry; but here the French advance was
checked and whole ranks were mowed down by the
English musketeers. New companies came storming
up, only to meet the same fate, and all without
any effect on the general result. The decisive
struggle took place at Blenheim; but here at first
every attack was in vain. Every garden wall, every
hedgerow and fence, was prepared for defence; and
the churchyard, which lay rather high, was transformed
into a small citadel. Marlborough quickly
changed his plan of attack. While he feigned attacks
on Blenheim, his principal blow was struck at the
enemy&rsquo;s centre, which Tallart had weakened considerably
by sending reinforcements to Blenheim.
But even here it was impossible to accomplish anything.
The French fought with the courage of
despair, and the English had to give way. At this
decisive moment Marlborough placed himself at the
head of the Danish troops, crossed the Nebelbach,
and attacked the French again with fresh energy.
Marsin&rsquo;s cavalry came dashing up and threw themselves
heavily upon the Danes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>All was wild confusion; already the Danes were
seeking a way for retreat, and all seemed lost. Just
then the imperial cuirassiers, led by Fugger, came
dashing up. With irresistible force they threw
themselves upon the enemy, renewed the firing,
and soon worsted the foe. The battle had been
raging for hours and was still, on the whole, undecided.
Eugene also had been fighting with the
same ill success. With but eleven battalions of
Prussians and seven battalions of Danes, he could
scarcely make any headway. Once more, however,
they put forth their utmost efforts. Such a bloody
battle had never been known. The attack was
begun by the Prussians under Leopold. It was a
difficult piece of work. From Lutzingen the enemy&rsquo;s
batteries poured death and destruction incessantly
into their ranks. The brave grenadiers furiously
threw themselves upon them and took them in a
wild struggle. But the Bavarians were soon on the
spot and the Prussians were driven back with great
loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Eugene collected the scattered forces and placed
himself at their head. The attack was unsuccessful.
It was impossible for the eighteen battalions
of infantry to wrest the victory from the twenty-five
battalions of the Elector. Eugene now called
on Marlborough for assistance, in expectation of
which the Prince went into the ranks, encouraging
the men, with word and example, to stand firm and
have courage. But time pressed, and before Marlborough&rsquo;s
reinforcements arrived the Prince had
made a third attack. His keen soldier&rsquo;s eye had
noted that the advantage was inclining toward
Marlborough&rsquo;s side. Now all depended on cutting
off the advance of the French right wing. The
cavalry should have undertaken this, but were so
disheartened by the repeated assaults that no great
success was to be depended on. Full of disdain,
Eugene turned his back on them and rode to the
Prussian infantry. These did their duty completely.
Regardless of danger they dashed forward under
Eugene&rsquo;s leadership, while the Prince of Dessau
encouraged his men to do the impossible. The
grenadiers loaded and fired as carefully as though
they were on the parade ground, and executed
evolutions which made the hearts of old and
young warriors laugh within them&mdash;until at last
the enemy began to retire through the forest and by
the ravine-road at Lutzingen. Here in the midst
of this wild scrimmage Eugene nearly lost his life.
A Bavarian cavalryman, who had probably recognized
him, was taking aim with his carbine, when
he was rendered harmless by an imperial officer
who came hurrying up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>And still the battle raged. The Bavarians fought
with the courage of lions and stood as firm as rocks
amid the sea. At last news came from the other
wing: Marlborough was gaining the advantage.
Marshal Tallart had been wounded and taken prisoner,
and Blenheim was surrounded by the English.
Now the cowardly and treacherous Clerambault
yielded his place, which was the key of the French
position, and the English pushed into Blenheim,
where they shot and cut down all who opposed them,
and made nine thousand prisoners.</p>
<p>Marlborough&rsquo;s trumpet-calls of victory were the
signal for Eugene also to make a quick end of things.
With the last strength of his battalions and squadrons&mdash;Prince
Leopold, with his Prussians, at the head&mdash;he
at last compelled the enemy to retreat. But
they gave way only by inches. The Bavarians still
fought with the utmost tenacity, defending every
foot of ground, until at last, completely weakened
and shot to pieces, they succumbed to the fire of
the Prussian infantry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Thus the Germans had gained a great and important,
but very bloody victory. Fifty-two thousand
Germans and English had fought against fifty-six
thousand French and Bavarians. Fourteen thousand
of the latter now covered the battle-field, and nearly
as many had been taken prisoners. The trophies
consisted of one hundred and forty cannon and a
great number of flags and standards. All Germany
and the greater part of Europe rejoiced over the
victory at Blenheim and the thorough humiliation
and chastisement of the French. Marlborough and
Eugene were the heroes of the day. The former
was created a prince of the holy Roman empire by
the Emperor, and Eugene&rsquo;s house in Vienna was
made perpetually free of taxation as a privileged
&ldquo;freehouse&rdquo; of the nobility.</p>
<p>In Paris, on the other hand, great discouragement
reigned. Almost every important family mourned
their dead or feared for a wounded or imprisoned
son. The despondency was general. And again it
was the former little <i>abb&eacute;</i> whose face was so distasteful
to Louis the Fourteenth that had brought
this misfortune upon him and his country. Had
the allies pursued the French as fast as they fled
toward the Rhine, the battle of Blenheim would have
had still more important results. This was part of
Eugene&rsquo;s plan; but in Vienna there was a group of
extremely circumspect gentlemen who had very
different views&mdash;&ldquo;clerks and scribblers,&rdquo; as Bl&uuml;cher
later named this distasteful guild.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Italian Campaign</span></h2>
<p>The French now wished to make up in Italy
what they had lost in Germany. The prospects
for this seemed very good. The Hungarians,
under the daring Count Alexander Karolyi,
were gathering in the neighborhood of Vienna; while
in Italy the imperial troops were starving.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The Emperor Leopold the First had grown old and
indifferent, and his characteristic indecision and lack
of self-confidence had increased. The faithful artillery
General, von Heister, drove the Hungarians
before him, and Eugene was again sent to Italy to
restore order and if possible clear the way. There
was one favorable circumstance. His uncle, Duke
Victor Amadeus, had at last broken his compact
with the French and had come over to the Emperor&rsquo;s
side. He had not received much benefit from his
friendship with the French. &ldquo;Hands off here, hands
off there,&rdquo; had been the cry, and there was no regard
for ties of relationship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>In Italy the two brothers, the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me
and the Grand Prior, were in command. Eugene
had first to deal with the latter, who was not particularly
brilliant. By means of marches and countermarches
he kept him busy, eluding him cleverly
when the Grand Prior thought to have surely
entrapped him. But this could not long continue.
Eugene soon became disgusted with the comedy.
In August, 1705, he confronted the Grand Prior at
the town of Cassano on the Adda. The position of
the enemy was excellent, while Eugene, besides the
eight thousand Prussians under Prince Leopold of
Dessau, possessed but a small army. Still he wished
to attack the Grand Prior, who had no idea that
the enemy was so close until he was enlightened
by messengers from his brother, the Duke. He was
now all the more alert, fearing a severe reprimand.
He placed his troops behind several canals and
garrisoned the island in the Adda, as well as a large
stone building which commanded the island and the
bridge leading to it, called the Osteria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>A heavy artillery fire from Eugene&rsquo;s side opened
the battle. Then the infantry fell in line, taking
the Osteria in a quick assault and endeavoring to
close the sluices of the canals. Just as they were
occupied with this difficult and to them puzzling
piece of work, the imperial troops were surprised by
a vigorous attack of the French regiments, by which
they were driven back and the Osteria taken from
them. The Austrians again captured the bridge and
building, but were obliged to give them up again and
again. At the head of his men Eugene stormed the
position for the third time, drove the enemy&rsquo;s ranks
into the river, and prepared to take the intrenchments.
But he was received with a heavy grenade
fire which swept away whole lines, so that he was
obliged to retire again.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me appeared
on the battle-field with fresh troops. It was Prince
Leopold who bore the first shock of their attack.
His soldiers had waded through the canals in order
to reach the enemy the sooner, and had attacked
them with their bayonets. But they were met by
such a murderous hail of bullets, great and small,
that the Prussians were obliged to withdraw. It
was only for a short time, however, just long enough
to take breath; for Dessau was not the man to be
so quickly repulsed. &ldquo;He is a cowardly dog who
deserts his general!&rdquo; he cried in a voice of thunder,
and was the first to plunge again into the canal,
followed by his grenadiers. Thus they victoriously
advanced and passed through two canals, and were
getting nearer and nearer to the foe, when for the
second time they were driven back by the furious
fire of the French cannon and rifles; and late in the
afternoon they took refuge with Eugene&rsquo;s exhausted
troops in a secure camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>It was at Cassano that the &ldquo;Dessau March&rdquo;
originated, a piece of music which was composed in
honor of Leopold, and which still enjoys great popularity.</p>
<p>The day at Cassano was a disastrous one for the
Germans, for more than a fifth of their army lay dead
or wounded on the battle-field. For a long time
Eugene was obliged to play at hide and seek with the
enemy, being now too weak to engage in open warfare.
But wherever he could injure the French, we
may be sure he did so. Eugene&rsquo;s bloody partisan
warfare is remembered to this day in Lombardy.</p>
<p>But in Paris they were evidently not quite satisfied
with the operations of the firm &ldquo;Vend&ocirc;me brothers.&rdquo;
Both of them were recalled and Duke Philip of
Orleans and Marshal Marsin intrusted with the
command of the army. This spurred Eugene on
to measure his strength with these new representatives.
Turin was the last refuge of Duke Victor
Amadeus of Savoy; this time-server had been thus
driven to extremity. Starhemberg held the city
with seven thousand men. A French army forty
thousand strong now appeared to besiege it. But
Eugene arrived on the ground before them. He
crossed the Po with thirty thousand men, passed
around the French intrenchments, crossed the Dora
also, and went into camp between this river and
the Stura.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>At daybreak on the seventh of September, 1706,
the troops of the allied armies broke camp. They
were divided into eight columns, of which four
formed the first and four the second division.
Scarcely had the French commanders noted Eugene&rsquo;s
plan when they sent large reinforcements to the
threatened spot and began a heavy cannonading.
Of course the imperial batteries did not remain
silent. This artillery battle thundered for more
than two hours. Meanwhile, in Turin, Count von
Daun was making ready with twelve battalions,
four hundred grenadiers, five hundred cavalrymen,
and six fieldpieces for a timely sortie. The inhabitants
of Turin witnessed the progress of the battle
from the walls and the roofs of the houses and
churches, praying devoutly for the success of the
German arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The Prussian troops had scarcely come up when
they were ordered to attack. Prince Leopold at
their head, they advanced upon the enemy as though
they were on the parade-ground, with erect, firm
bearing and without firing a shot. A terrific fire
greeted them; the enemies&rsquo; bullets swept them in
front and in the flank, and although they answered
with a very rapid battalion fire, the battle was too
unequal and they were obliged to retire. As soon
as Eugene noticed this he hurried to the spot, to
the support of the brave Prussian regiments, with
the remainder of the left wing, which was soon followed
by the centre and the right wing. The fighting
broke out all along the long line of battle. Both
sides fought recklessly, neither advancing, but on
the other hand neither giving way.</p>
<p>Eugene&rsquo;s attention was centred on the Prussians;
the Prince of Dessau, his valiant ally of H&ouml;chst&auml;dt
and Cassano, seemed to him the right man to strike
a tremendous blow. It needed but a few words.
Leopold, the &ldquo;bull-dog,&rdquo; as Eugene is said to have
called him, threw himself with his already much
decimated battalions with terrific fury upon the
enemy&rsquo;s intrenchments. Nothing intimidated the
faithful fellows, nothing could stop them. They
crossed the moat, took the redoubts, and intrenched
themselves therein. Eugene was in the midst of
them. His horse was shot under him and he fell to
the ground. The terror of death was upon him.
But no!&mdash;immediately he arose and hurried on, at
the head of his men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Simultaneously with this brilliant success, the
Prince of W&uuml;rttemberg penetrated the intrenchments
from the opposite side. Eugene&rsquo;s positive
orders were that the left wing should occupy the
intrenchments which had been taken until the right
wing and the centre had also taken the intrenchments.
But alas! in the enthusiasm of victory the
left wing hurried after their advancing brothers,
and the fortifications remained unprotected. But
Eugene was watching the progress of the battle.
Starhemberg&rsquo;s regiment was called upon, occupied
the fortifications, turned the captured French cannon
about and shelled the fleeing enemy with them. The
French at the centre fought just as doggedly. There
Philip of Orleans and Marsin were in command.
Three times the intrenchments were taken by the
allies; three times they were recaptured by the
French, until, at last, the Duke of Savoy took them
for the fourth time&mdash;and held them.</p>
<p>Thus the French were repulsed at all points. In
great disorder they hurried toward the Po and the
Dora. It was now the faithful Daun&rsquo;s turn. He
received them, not with open arms, but with powder
and lead instead, took part of them prisoners and
drove the rest into the cold waters of the river, to
cool the heat of their flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Thus the rule of the French in Milan was overthrown.
Amidst the boundless rejoicings of the
delivered city, Eugene made his entry into it, as its
imperial governor. From this time the plans of
Louis the Fourteenth were frustrated. He must
have been sick enough with rage at the little <i>abb&eacute;</i>,
for the pills he had had to swallow in Italy were
bitter as gall. And still the triumphs of Germany
over the French were not complete. While a small
imperial force marched straight to Naples to harass
the French there, Eugene and Victor Amadeus made
ready to carry the war into Southern France. After
an extremely arduous march over the Alps, they
reached Valette, which lies about a half-hour&rsquo;s march
from Toulon, and went into camp there. During
the following days Toulon was shelled by the Austrians.
Nothing more was done, however, as the
French were gathering in ever increasing numbers;
so Eugene wisely withdrew. The fall of Toulon was
the dearest wish of the English and Hollanders, but
Eugene preferred not to burn his fingers in their
interests. Besides, from the standpoint of the soldier,
his retreat through the enemy&rsquo;s country was
a greater feat than the storming of Toulon would
have been. On the road he casually took Susa;
and he arrived again in Vienna in the Autumn of
1707, where he was greeted at court, as well as by
the people, as the deliverer of Italy. He met with a
brilliant and extremely friendly reception.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Malplaquet</span></h2>
<p>The Duke of Marlborough had fought against
France in the Netherlands in recent years,
with more or less success. But latterly
fortune had turned her back upon him; Ghent,
Brussels, Bruges, and other fortified towns had again
fallen into the hands of the French; for Marshal
Vend&ocirc;me and the Duke of Burgundy were very alert
generals.</p>
<p>One of Marlborough&rsquo;s letters to Lord Godolphin
shows how deeply he felt the hopelessness of his
situation. He wrote: &ldquo;As there is a God in heaven
I put my trust in Him, for without Him our prospects
are truly terrible.&rdquo; Eugene did not wish to
desert the brave Duke in this great extremity.
To be sure, money was scarce in Vienna; Hungary
and Siebenb&uuml;rgen could contribute nothing, the
impoverished hereditary lands were just as unable to
furnish sufficient ready money, and loans were to
be had only at exorbitant rates. In addition, there
was a split in the parties at court. They were weary
of war, and one interfered with another&rsquo;s counsels
and plans. It was almost a miracle that it was possible
for Eugene to impose his plans for war upon
the Council, and to organize a well-trained army
in the shortest possible time. It was, no doubt,
Marlborough&rsquo;s messengers of distress, and his own
extreme sense of duty urging him not to desert
his faithful brother-in-arms, which conquered all
obstacles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>With indefatigable haste Eugene set out with his
army, crossed the Moselle on the twenty-eighth of
June, 1708, and joined the cavalry on the third of
July at D&uuml;ren. A few days later his army and
Marlborough&rsquo;s were united. This was help in time
of need. The first meeting of the two generals
was touching. Marlborough embraced Eugene and
called him his saviour. The noble Savoyard directed
his friend to trust in God. &ldquo;With His help,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;even though I pay the penalty with my life,
I shall obtain satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Eugene next hurried to Brussels, which the French
had again given up, into the arms of his mother,
whom he had not seen since she was driven from
France. What must have been the feelings of
mother and son? Eugene had taken vengeance on
their deadly enemy for her and the whole family
of Soissons, and had punished and humiliated him.
He had already twice entered France at the head of
a victorious army, he had been successful in the
Netherlands, and the road to Paris was open to him.
Full of happiness and enthusiasm the mother parted
from her heroic son. And soon new tidings of victory
arrived to gladden the lonely widow. The aged
woman passed away on the arrival of the news of
the victory of Malplaquet (1709). She died happy,
for her beloved son had avenged her husband and
herself.</p>
<p>Marlborough and Eugene with eighty thousand
men came upon the enemy at Oudenarde. The
French leaders disagreed as thoroughly among themselves
as the allies were united. They had forgotten
to protect the bridges over the Scheldt. The allies
used five of these and on the eleventh of July, 1708,
crossed the river; as they arrived they placed themselves
according to battalions in battle array.</p>
<p>How easily the French might have prevented this
and have attacked the separated little companies and
conquered them! They chose quite different tactics&mdash;they
hastily intrenched themselves. It was the
English Colonel Cadogan who first dealt with the
enemy. He easily overthrew the twenty squadrons
opposed to him, scattered four battalions of infantry,
and in doing so he frightened three others so thoroughly
that they ran away without firing a shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>That was a merry introduction, but the real
drama was to follow. Marlborough now advanced
with the principal strength of the army. The
French defended themselves with the utmost bravery;
and as they were much more numerous, they
forced the English back. But Marlborough was of
a tenacious character. With all his might he again
pressed forward, not only reconquering the lost
ground, but continually advancing. Eugene knew
how to gain successes of the same sort. The allies
bore down ever more heavily upon the French. The
battle became disorganized and ended in a series of
bloody hand-to-hand skirmishes. But the English
and Germans understood this kind of fighting also,
for they had learned it under the murderous fire at
H&ouml;chst&auml;dt.</p>
<p>Toward evening the Hollanders received orders
to march round the French right wing, a task that
they accomplished with remarkable quickness and
precision. The allies then pressed forward in a great
half-circle and overthrew the enemy. Seven of the
enemy&rsquo;s cavalry regiments were cut down, and Vend&ocirc;me&rsquo;s
battalions of the guard, led by himself, were
shattered by the iron knights of England. At sunset
the day had been gloriously won; a victory like
that of H&ouml;chst&auml;dt. Vend&ocirc;me fled to Ghent, and there
remained three days in bed to sleep off his chagrin.</p>
<p>After the battle of Oudenarde the allied armies
remained in the Netherlands. In Eugene&rsquo;s own
words, it was now time &ldquo;to profit honestly by the
victory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In order to accomplish this it was necessary to
take a fortified place, and Lille or Ryssel seemed to
Eugene the most appropriate. He was not a waverer
or one who would discard to-morrow the plans of
yesterday; and in this Marlborough was his faithful
colleague. Then quickly to work! The allies shelled
the fortress of Lille daily with a hundred and twenty
cannon, eighty mortars, and twenty howitzers. This
must certainly have helped matters. Marshal Vend&ocirc;me&rsquo;s
fingers were itching to relieve Lille, which
Marlborough with his seventy thousand men prevented,
holding the Marshal at a good distance, so
that Eugene could operate with freedom against the
fortifications. At last the Austrians had opened a
breach. Eugene was quickly on the ground. One
night he advanced to the breach with the storming
columns, but was very unlucky. The enemy must
have learned of his design; they received the advancing
columns with a murderous fire of grapeshot and
also set off two powder-mines with horrible results.
Of course the Austrians were obliged to retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>But postponement is not abandonment; and the
maxim, &ldquo;A burnt child shuns the fire,&rdquo; did not apply
to Eugene. One night he was again before the
breach. All was ready for the onslaught. The
roll of the drums and the calls of horns and trumpets
were kindling the Austrians with enthusiasm, but
it was a difficult piece of work. Three times they
were beaten back, but the fourth time they were
successful. Several outposts were taken and occupied.
During this attack Eugene was slightly
wounded on the head. He transferred the command
to Marlborough, knowing it to be in good hands.</p>
<p>About this time Eugene received, among other
letters, one which on opening he found to contain
a piece of blank paper which had been soaked in
some greasy, sticky stuff. Eugene dropped the
paper and said: &ldquo;It is not the first of its kind which
I have received.&rdquo; Of course the paper was poisoned.
It was bound about the neck of a dog, and after a
few hours the animal died.</p>
<p>But let us return to the siege of Lille. On the
third of October the grand attack was made. Both
sides fought with admirable courage. Eugene, as
well as Bouffleurs, gave his men an example worthy
of emulation; both fought in the front ranks. Eugene
was wounded and fell to the ground. His men raised
a shout of horror. &ldquo;It is nothing!&rdquo; he cried, covered
the wound with his handkerchief and pressed forward.
It was with great difficulty that his friends
could persuade him to leave the battle-field while
the assault was proceeding. A terrible slaughter
began. The Frenchmen defended every inch of
ground with heroic courage. The men fought with
bayonets; they strangled one another with their
hands; and all the time the heavy artillery of the
besiegers was thundering and was opening new
breaches here and there. Where the moats were
not filled with wounded or dead bodies, they were
piled up with bits of sod, gabions, and bundles of
faggots to make them passable. At last Bouffleurs
lost all hope of holding the city. Fighting, he retired
into the citadel, which, after a defence of two
months, he at last also surrendered to the allies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Without reading the conditions of surrender,
Eugene signed the paper with the words: &ldquo;Marshal
Bouffleurs cannot demand anything which I shall
not be able to grant!&rdquo; Nobly spoken, valiant
Knight!</p>
<p>When they wished to give grand <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> at The Hague
in honor of the Prince, he begged them rather to give
the large sums of money which would have been
expended to the faithful Dutch soldiers who had
been invalided at the defence of Lille. Eugene had
the gratifying consciousness of having also freed
Flanders from the French by his prompt interference.
In the following words he shows what importance
he attributed to the campaign of 1708: &ldquo;He who
was not in it has never experienced anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The peace negotiations at The Hague between the
warring powers came to nothing. After the last
great victories Eugene was able to press his claims
in the name of his Emperor (Joseph the First). He
demanded the whole undivided Spanish inheritance,
also Alsace and Sundgau, the bishoprics of Metz,
Toul, and Verdun, which had formerly been unjustly
taken from the German empire. After a long period
of weakness in state and international affairs, this
was once more a virile German demand. The Marquis
de Lorcy, a suave French courtier, the representative
of Louis the Fourteenth at The Hague,
opened his eyes very wide and begged leave to
communicate this demand to the King. As was
anticipated, Louis declined the terms of peace.
The storms of war began anew to discharge their
fury upon the frightened nations. The Germans,
together with the English and Dutch, were once
more quickly in the field. Every one felt that the
new campaign would be a very sanguinary one.
The injured vanity of the French King demanded
atonement, revenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Against about one hundred thousand allies, Louis
put one hundred and twenty thousand men in the
field. Villars, with whom we became acquainted
during the Italian campaign, made great promises
to the Parisians. The first task was to take the
fortress of Tournay from the French. This was
successful. The next was to arrive at Mons before
the French. It was also accomplished. This was
Villar&rsquo;s <i>d&eacute;but</i>, and the King of France was not
greatly pleased. He sent the brave Bouffleurs after
him to urge him on, for his confidence in Villars was
still unshaken. Besides, Bouffleurs did not come
alone, but brought with him a valiant troop. The
gay Marshal was much elated; and was quite confident
of victory. And with him the whole French
army rejoiced, convinced that they should strike
the Germans a deadly blow and then themselves
dictate the terms of peace.</p>
<p>While the French gave themselves up to these
undue rejoicings, Eugene and Marlborough were
composedly making all arrangements to wreck the
Marshal&rsquo;s plan and spoil his fun. They quickly
set out with ninety thousand men and occupied all
the highways, in order to prevent the enemy from
reaching Mons.</p>
<p>Mons lies in the province of Hainaut. This
region is hilly for the most part, cut up by gorges
and little streams, and covered thickly with timber.
In front of Marlborough&rsquo;s position lay the forest
of Lani&egrave;re; in front of Eugene&rsquo;s, the forest of Taisni&egrave;re.
The corner which juts out toward the north
is called the forest of Sart. Between the above-mentioned
forests lie Aulnoit and the Wolf&rsquo;s Cave.
The first was occupied by Marlborough, and the last
by Eugene; between them was a series of more or
less deep ravines. It was in no respect a well-selected
position; it was taken only because it was
necessary to put themselves quickly on the defensive
against a threatened attack of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Villars&rsquo;s centre stood upon the clearing of Aulnoit,
his wings were covered by the above-mentioned
forests. Besides this he had intrenchments thrown
up in haste and barricades constructed. He must
have been somewhat nervous. The allied generals
observed the enemy&rsquo;s position from the windmill
at Sart. Their plan was to engage the attention of
the enemy&rsquo;s centre by a feigned attack, while they
really were trying to throw the left wing from its
position. Between Marlborough and Eugene, eighteen
battalions of imperial infantry were posted.</p>
<p>In the early hours of a cold, wet, September morning,
the ninth, the allied armies quietly gathered under
their standards, while the Frenchmen, on the other
hand, being confident of an easy victory, were cheering
continuously for their King and for Marshal
Villars. As usual the thunder of the cannon opened
the battle. Amidst their brazen clangor, the Saxons
under Schulenberg pressed forward on the edge of
the forest of Sart to within pistol-shot of the enemy.
But there the valiant Albergotti opened such a heavy
musketry fire on them that the battalions at the
front fell back panic-stricken and were stopped only
by those behind them. United they pushed forward
once more, Eugene leading them. The first redoubt
was taken by storm, and soon afterwards the second
also was taken. Eugene&rsquo;s infantry followed eagerly
in the victorious path of their advancing comrades,
but were soon retarded by a thick growth of bushes
and trees. The battalions were separated and at
last became thoroughly disordered. The worst of
it was, that they came upon a fresh barricade of
logs. But great as the difficulties were, they were
conquered at last; the forest of Sart was taken, and
the French driven out of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>While these events were taking place in Eugene&rsquo;s
division, the Prussian General von Lottum, of Marlborough&rsquo;s
division, with twenty-two battalions, made
a daring attack on the principal front of the French
left wing, where Villars himself commanded. Although
whole ranks of the faithful grenadiers fell
before the enemy&rsquo;s grapeshot and musketry hail,
they worked their way forward with astonishing
endurance and had the pleasure of seeing Villars
retreating behind the forest.</p>
<p>While he was busy re-forming his line of battle he
was surprised by the Prince of Orange with thirty
battalions. A fierce fight ensued. The French
defended themselves heroically and repulsed their
assailants. But not for long; for Eugene came to
the rescue. On horseback he reduced the wild confusion
of the battle, encouraging here, praising there,
or consoling. Once more he was wounded by a
musket ball, in the back of his head. He had no
time to have the wound dressed. To his remonstrating
friends he smilingly said: &ldquo;If I should die, the
bandage would do me no good, and if I live, the
surgeon can do his work this evening.&rdquo; Thus he
plunged again into the fury of the battle. And still
there was no decisive victory although Marlborough&rsquo;s
and Eugene&rsquo;s troops fought so bravely. But the
heroic Prince&rsquo;s eye is alert and is watching, in spite
of great loss of blood and intense pain from the
wound in his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>At last the decisive moment came. Hazarding a
last tremendous blow, for his troops were exhausted
by the long struggle, Villars sent thirty battalions
with lowered bayonets against Eugene. In order
to do this he had drawn a large part of the infantry
from the redoubts on his right, which Bouffleurs
until now had defended so heroically. Eugene immediately
espied the vulnerable point and, gathering
his infantry together, he dashed upon the much
weakened left wing of the foe. Here another terrible
struggle took place. But all their bravery and heroic
devotion availed the French nothing. At the head
of his men Eugene broke through their centre. His
men were not to be held back any longer. Starhemberg&rsquo;s
cavalry rode and cut down everything that
resisted them; the platoon fire of several Prussian
battalions likewise did terrible destruction. The
French fled.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>PRINCE EUGENE
<br />before the battle of Malplaquet</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The other wing of the allies was equally fortunate.
Excited by the victorious shouts of the Germans,
the English were not left behind. With fifteen
battalions supported by seventeen squadrons under
B&uuml;low, Orkney took the intrenchments at Bleron.
The Prince of Orange, the hero of the day, again
took an important part in the battle; and although
an extremely fierce cavalry skirmish ensued upon
the plain of Malplaquet and the Frenchmen enjoyed
a few victorious moments, the imperial cavalry from
the other wing, appearing like a stormcloud on the
field of battle, overwhelmed the enemy with tremendous
force. They gave way and fled. Unfortunately,
the allies were too exhausted to pursue
them effectually. Only twelve squadrons of the
imperial cavalry harassed them on their retreat,
which was conducted skilfully by Bouffleurs.</p>
<p>The battle of Malplaquet, as the fight over the
French intrenchments was called, was one of the
fiercest of the War of the Spanish Succession.
The loss on both sides in dead and wounded was
about the same, probably about thirty-six thousand
men. The great battle-field was horrible to look
upon. Where the Dutch battalions of the guard
had stood, the corpses lay in ranks before the
intrenchments, most of them stripped of their clothes
and horribly mutilated. The moats were filled to
the top with dead bodies. The allied victors spent
the night upon the battle-field. What a night! as
terrible as the day had been!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The battle of Malplaquet was the last in the long
and extremely bloody War of the Spanish Succession,
excepting several clever operations against the
French, and minor encounters. For a long time
the discussions over &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;thine&rdquo; continued.
The French were scarcely able to resign themselves,
but at last, after negotiations between the several
States, in February, 1714, peace was made between
the Emperor Charles the Sixth (Joseph the First had
died in 1711) and King Louis the Fourteenth of
France at Rastadt. This was for the most part
Eugene&rsquo;s work; and his opponent at the green table
was Marshal Villars. Eugene raised his voice powerfully
in Germany&rsquo;s interest; Germany was indebted
to him for whatever he succeeded in obtaining under
many unfortunate and unfavorable circumstances.
France kept Landau, but resigned the other territories
which she had conquered; Milan, Naples,
Sardinia, and the Spanish Netherlands passed to the
Emperor.</p>
<p>Villars and Eugene parted friends at Rastadt.
They had learned to respect one another. At their
farewell Villars uttered these parting words: &ldquo;Your
foes are not in the enemy&rsquo;s camp, but in Vienna,
as mine are in Versailles.&rdquo; This was a prophecy
which was later to be fulfilled in a terrible manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Eugene at Belgrade</span></h2>
<p>After a few years of peace we see Eugene
again taking up his sword against the
Turks. The Venetians needed assistance
against the Sublime Porte. At first it was thought
that all difficulties could be settled by the pen, but
the gentlemen in Constantinople assumed such an
arrogant tone that it was impossible for Vienna to
countenance it. Besides, the imperial house was
much more powerful than in former days, when the
Turks had advanced to the very gates of Vienna.
Having vanquished the French, Austria was confident
that she could conquer the Turks also. But
the latter thought otherwise and were determined
to regain what they had lost, at all costs. We shall
see what happened.</p>
<p>Appointed imperial Governor-General of the Netherlands&mdash;no
slight proof of the boundless confidence
of his Emperor and master&mdash;Prince Eugene of
Savoy prepared for a valiant defence against the
grimmest foe of Christendom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Surrounded by a group of heroes, including the
daring Heister (called &ldquo;the scourge of the Turks&rdquo;),
the excellent cavalry commander Palffy, Prince
Alexander of W&uuml;rttemberg, the faithful Mercy, the
expert soldier Starhemberg, and others, he left
Vienna in order to join the army which was gathering
at Peterwardein, in the Summer of 1716.</p>
<p>The Turks meanwhile had not been dilatory.
Their army, numbering at least two hundred thousand
men, was, according to Turkish standards, well
fitted out and amply furnished with all requisites.
Relying upon this, the Grand Vizier Ali wrote to
the Field-Marshal General, Prince Eugene, among
other things, these words: &ldquo;The Ottoman Empire
expects to win much glory and many victories in
this campaign, whereas your shameful conduct will
bring, not only upon you, but upon your children
and grandchildren, misfortunes and curses and a
shameful defeat.&rdquo; The Turks put on an air of innocence,
but everyone knew just what to expect from
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>It was not long before the two armies were standing
face to face, for both sides appeared to be in
great haste. Field-Marshal Palffy, with a small
body of men, hazarded a bold ride in order to reconnoitre
the enemy&rsquo;s position. Their expedition led
them through ravines and ditches and demanded a
great deal of courage. Suddenly twenty thousand
Turkish horsemen fell upon Palffy&rsquo;s company of
scarcely two thousand men. In this rough country
retreat and advance were equally dangerous; it was
a desperate situation. But their gallant leader did
not lose his head. He and his men defended themselves
bravely and the enemy were badly worsted
in spite of their advantage in numbers; and Palffy
got safely back to Eugene. It now seemed as though
the Turks were preparing to besiege Peterwardein.
They dug trenches, threw up earthworks, erected
redoubts, and continually shelled Eugene&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>He was not the man to put up quietly with these
annoyances for any length of time. His plan was
to attack the enemy before they had become established
in their new position or had seized the means
for an energetic defence. With his characteristic
rapidity Eugene made all his arrangements for an
attack. The fourth of August was to be the decisive
day. The Turks must have noticed that something
was about to happen. They were stirring
very early; and as it grew lighter, one could see hill
and valley covered with the countless ranks of their
hosts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Eugene&rsquo;s left
wing commenced the attack. Prince Alexander of
W&uuml;rttemberg led the first storming column. Without
meeting with any particular resistance he took
one of the enemy&rsquo;s batteries, while the imperial
cavalry, which followed his infantry, put the Turkish
horsemen to flight. The troops were overjoyed at
this; but the hardest work was still to come. Simultaneously
with this attack, the imperial infantry,
which was occupying the other intrenchments, was
to advance on the enemy. In the narrow passages
of the earthworks this man&oelig;uvre was not executed
with the expected precision. It took longer to form
the ranks outside the intrenchments than had been
expected. Taking advantage of this, the Turks
threw themselves on the advancing enemy in overpowering
numbers. With fierce cries they drove
them back, pushing forward with them into the first
and second lines of intrenchments, but were quickly
driven out again by the imperial cavalry, which came
dashing up.</p>
<p>The infantry re-formed their ranks and again
rapidly advanced. There was another terrific encounter.
The imperial cuirassiers held the advantage;
whatever came within reach was cut down
by their terrific blows. The light Turkish cavalry
were scattered like spray before the wind. However,
they still fought with iron endurance and were even
successful here and there. One section of the imperial
infantry was repulsed again and again. The
Turks, with loud cries of victory, began the pursuit
in the heat of the fight; but in doing so exposed both
of their flanks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>This was the moment for Eugene to strike a
decisive blow. With the rapidity of lightning he
threw Heister&rsquo;s cavalry on the left wing of the enemy.
The battalions of the Prince of W&uuml;rttemberg attacked
them on the right and in the centre; the scattered
columns were re-forming for a new and victorious
assault. Attacked from three sides at once with
great fury, shelled by the cannon from the walls of
Peterwardein, succumbing in bloody bayonet fights
with their antagonists, and overthrown in a hand-to-hand
struggle with the more powerful German soldiers,
the Turks turned for a hurried flight. After
them in furious haste stormed the German cavalry.
Whole regiments were cut down and others taken
prisoners. The Germans assaulted the last stronghold
of the Turks, their wagon-barricade: further
resistance was useless.</p>
<p>While the imperial commander Prince Eugene,
on horseback and exposed to all the hardships and
dangers of the fight, had been directing the battle,
the Grand Vizier Ali had not for a moment left
his tent, where he had been standing immovable
beside the sacred banner of the Prophet. The
flight of his troops at last aroused him. With his
naked sabre he went to meet the fleeing men and
cut down several of them. He implored, he commanded,
he cursed them. All in vain. The current
of flight and defeat was not to be stemmed. He
then placed himself at the head of his bodyguard,
plunged into the tide of battle, and soon fell mortally
wounded. His defeated and disorganized army
hastened on to Belgrade. Temesvar was taken by
the Austrians. Eugene had occasion once more to
hold a thanksgiving service on the field of battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Eugene&rsquo;s victory at Peterwardein caused great
enthusiasm throughout the whole of Europe. The
Savoyard was the f&ecirc;ted hero of young and old, aristocrat
and humble citizen. While the blessings of
the whole German people were following him on
his path of victory, the monarchs of Europe were
vying with one another in offering him tokens of
their admiration and gratitude. The Pope presented
him with a consecrated hat and sword, and
Marshal Villars honored the famous hero of Peterwardein
with a personal letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Although the defeat of the Turks had been so
complete and so terrible, they could not rest until
they tried their luck in a second campaign. The
whole of Europe rejoiced over this news, not doubting
that the old arch-enemy of Christendom would now
receive his death-blow. Young nobles and the chief
princes flocked to the imperial standards in order
to join in the fight against the Turks and to study
the art of war under Eugene&rsquo;s leadership. As usual,
he was now prompt and ready. On the ninth of
June, 1717, he set out from Peterwardein; on the
fourteenth he was at Pancsova; and on the fifteenth
and sixteenth the imperial army crossed the Danube.
He purposed no less a feat than &ldquo;to reconquer for
the Emperor&rdquo; the fortress of Belgrade, which was
garrisoned by thirty thousand picked Turkish
troops. This was an extremely hazardous undertaking,
for two hundred thousand Turks under
command of the Grand Vizier Chalis of Adrianople
were already on their way to interfere with his plans.
But in spite of this, the Christian army was in good
spirits, and their confidence was absolute in their
general, who was bold, as well as gifted, and seasoned
in battle.</p>
<p>This occasion again brought into play all the resources
of Eugene&rsquo;s genius. He had to prepare for
defence in two directions: first, against a sortie of
the garrison; and secondly, against an attack from
the Turkish army of relief. For this purpose he
protected his camp by quickly constructed fort-like
walls, deep, wide trenches, earthworks, and rifle-pits.
At the same time he caused exits to be made
in the principal wall here and there, so that in case
of danger from the outside, his men would be able
to reach the open field quickly. He bridged over
the morasses, caused the sconce of the Semlin bridge
on the Banat side of the Danube to be garrisoned,
the island in the Danube at Belgrade to be protected
by redoubts&mdash;in short he did everything that forethought
and care could suggest to hold off and if
possible to crush an enemy possessing three times
his strength.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>In the midst of these extensive preparations for
the battle Eugene was surprised by a fearful natural
catastrophe. A mighty hurricane broke loose, tearing
the heavy iron chains that bound the ships, as
though they had been hempen ropes, destroying the
bridges which had been constructed, and dashing
the Austrian and Turkish vessels lying in the Danube
into a confused heap. Taking advantage of this
disturbance, ten thousand Turks crossed the Save to
take the Austrian intrenchments. An unexampled
confusion took possession of the Germans; but a
Hessian captain, quickly gathering together his half
company, threw himself against the numerous advancing
foes. He had the courage and good fortune
to be able to hold his ground until two grenadier
companies hurried to the scene and drove back the
enemy. While this event was taking place, the
janissaries had fixed their attention upon the Austrian
intrenchments. With resounding cries to Allah
they were soon inside, massacring the bewildered
Austrian soldiers, but were as quickly surprised by
two hundred and fifty cuirassiers, who came dashing
up to ride them down or drive them into the angry
waters of the Danube. At the same time the imperial
batteries opened a murderous fire on Belgrade.
Large sections of the fortifications were levelled to
the ground, and the water-front of the city was laid
in ruins. Then the news was brought to Prince
Eugene that Chalis was approaching with reinforcements.
At first, merely a rumor to which little
credence was given, it soon turned out to be a fact.
Hussars and Servians began to arrive at the fortifications,
which had already been occupied by their
forerunners, the light Turkish Cavalry skirmishers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>A few days later, Eugene had the foe before and
behind him. Shelled from all sides, Eugene needed
great coolness. Thousands would have lost their
heads in such a situation. His resolution was
taken. While a very small part of his army kept
guard over Belgrade, with the remaining forty thousand
men he boldly challenged the Grand Vizier
Chalis. Eugene&rsquo;s situation at Belgrade recalls in
many respects that of Werder at Belfort. The
infantry formed the centre, the cavalry was posted
on the wings. No one could deceive himself as to
the seriousness of the situation. There were but
two courses open; to conquer, or to die! And in
a council of war Eugene said plainly enough:
&ldquo;Either I shall gain possession of Belgrade or the
Turks will take me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The officers were commanded to give their orders
coolly and quietly, without shouting or showing impatience.
Neither officer nor soldier was allowed
to leave his appointed place, and no one on pain of
death should seek for spoils or plunder. Lastly,
the soldiers were reminded that they had to do with
Turks, Tartars, and enemies of that sort, from whom
there was little to fear if they were met with due
coolness and firmness. Shortly after midnight the
regiments moved out of the intrenchments to place
themselves in battle array.</p>
<p>It was a cold, clear night in August, so the Turks
could observe the marching of the troops. It was
not until nearly daylight that a fog covered the
landscape, so dense that the nearest objects could
not be distinguished. Enveloped in this gray veil
the Austrians advanced on the Turkish fortifications.
The fog was now so thick that in spite of
all precautions Palffy&rsquo;s cavalry lost their way. As
the infantry had orders to follow the cavalry, they
also got too far to the right. In this way an empty
space was left in the centre, which the Turks immediately
filled out with several battalions, so that
they were in the midst of the Austrian position.</p>
<p>Thus the battle began; and soon the whole right
wing was involved in a bitter fight. Palffy&rsquo;s cavalry
were worthy of all honor; every one of them
fought like a hero, but against such overwhelming
numbers their destruction was certain. It was
General von Mercy who hurried to the relief of his
brothers-in-arms; the gallant Starhemberg also,
with his infantry, was not behindhand. With irresistible
energy the battalions attacked the enemy at
the front, and the cavalry fell upon his flank. Such
an onslaught could not be sustained for any length
of time. The Turks fled, leaving their batteries in
the hands of the Austrians.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>PRINCE EUGENE
<br />at Belgrade</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>During this fighting on the right wing, the battle
broke out gradually along the whole line. The fog
had become still denser and more impenetrable.
Both sides fired without being able to see one
another. In slow marching order the Austrian
infantry moved forward. Coming upon the Turkish
trenches they took them quickly by storm and
crossed over upon the corpses of their foes.</p>
<p>In other parts of the great battle-field the Turks
were gaining the advantage. A large body of their
troops, led astray by the fog, found itself again
between the two separated wings of the Austrians.
That meant some desperate fighting. Toward eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning a light breeze at last scattered
the mists which, until now, had hidden the battle-field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>A single glance over the confused panorama showed
Eugene the fearful danger in which he stood. It
was such moments as these, however, which demonstrated
his greatness. With him decision and execution
were one. The enemy must not be allowed
to make use of their advantage. Prince von Bevern
received orders to throw himself impetuously upon
them with the second division; Eugene at the head
of the united cavalry regiments stormed their flanks.
The Turks defended themselves lustily, especially
as they had now discovered, too late, their favorable
position. There was no power to resist the tremendous
onslaught of the Austrians, the Turks wavered,
gave way; the battle line was once more established.
And now the drums rolled, the horns pealed forth,
and the flags waved aloft&mdash;the signal for a general
attack on the Turkish camp all along the line.</p>
<p>There were many bleeding heads; there was no
holding back on either side; they surged back and
forth. Only one Turkish battery upon a hill was
holding its own. From its eighteen cannon it poured
forth death and destruction upon the advancing
Austrians. This must be taken and silenced. Ten
companies of grenadiers and four battalions whose
wings were covered by squadrons of cavalry were
assigned the task of taking the battery by storm.
With flying banners and bands playing, marching
close together, shoulder to shoulder as compact as
a wall, the brave fellows pressed forward. They
were met by a terrific fire, which tore deep gaps in
their ranks. Regardless of their falling comrades,
passing over their wounded and dead bodies, they
pressed onward with loud cries of victory, and
reached the top. Without firing a shot, with lowered
bayonets they charged the enemy (mostly janissaries)
like a stormcloud, until all were cut down and the
battery was taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It was exactly nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning when
the enemy left their fortified camp in great haste.
The gradually decreasing thunder of the Austrian
cannon accompanied them, but the light cavalry
pursued the defeated Turks. It was a great battle
and a great victory! The Turks lost about twenty
thousand men, while Eugene&rsquo;s loss was but fifteen
hundred. The trophies of war included nearly two
hundred cannon, one hundred and fifty flags, and
nine horsetails, not forgetting the captured treasure
in the deserted Turkish camp, consisting of bejewelled
weapons and other articles of luxury.</p>
<p>Eugene sent General Count Hamilton at once
with news of the victory to the Emperor, Charles
the Sixth. The anxious suspense of all minds had
been so great on account of Eugene&rsquo;s dangerous
situation that the rejoicings were unbounded. As
Count Hamilton, according to the custom of that
time, after having delivered his message to the
Emperor, accompanied by the pealing tones of the
six postillions of &ldquo;the Favorite&rdquo; who rode before
him, passed through the K&auml;rnthner gate into the
city, across the moat and by way of the Kohlmarkt
to the Castle, the crowds were so great that the
carriage could scarcely make its way through them.
A few days later, Colonel Count Rabutin brought
the news that Belgrade also had surrendered. Nearly
six hundred cannon, the whole flotilla on the Danube,
and a great deal of ammunition fell into the hands
of the victors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>One year later, after the Turks had been defeated
in several more small skirmishes and battles, Prince
Eugene made peace with them, in the name of the
Emperor, at Passarowitz. Banat, Slavonia, a part
of Bosnia, Servia, and Wallachia passed over to
Austria, not forgetting Hungary, which had been
conquered before this. The strangest part of the
affair was, that even the Turkish Sultan could not
abstain from showing Eugene how highly he esteemed
him. The Turkish ambassador was instructed to
present the Prince with two Arabian horses, a costly
sword, and a turban. At the same time he accompanied
the presents with the explanation: &ldquo;The
sabre is the symbol of your valor; the others are
for your keen wit, your wise counsel, and wiser
execution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Last Days</span></h2>
<p>After a peaceful interval of sixteen years,
during which Eugene had devoted himself
to the study of the arts and sciences, he was
obliged once more to take up his sword. France was
again menacing the peace of Europe. She was not
willing that the Elector of Saxony should become
King of Poland, but presented another candidate and
seized this opportunity of picking a quarrel with
Austria and Germany. Eugene therefore found himself
promptly seated in the saddle once more, ready to
show the King of France (now Louis the Fifteenth)
that he still understood his profession. Unfortunately
this war was begun and conducted in a very
sleepy fashion, so that Eugene had only twenty
thousand men to oppose the one hundred and twenty
thousand Frenchmen, instead of the imposing army
originally promised him by the Emperor; and even
though this small number was gradually doubled
by accessions of Prussians and other troops of the
empire, it was not possible to undertake anything
important with them. In spite of this Eugene
man&oelig;uvred so cleverly with his little army that in
a two-years&rsquo; campaign (1734-1735) France gained
no great advantage on the Rhine and took possession
only of Philippsburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>As things stood&mdash;the Emperor without money,
the army unpaid and without bread&mdash;it was almost
a miracle that France did not gain more advantages.
It was Eugene, the conqueror at Zenta, H&ouml;chst&auml;dt,
Turin, Oudenarde, Malplaquet, Peterwardein, and
Belgrade who prevented it. In this war against
France Eugene made the personal acquaintance of
the Crown Prince of Prussia, later King Frederick
the Great. Frederick greeted the noble Knight
with the significant words: &ldquo;I should like to be
allowed to witness the manner in which a hero collects
his laurels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eugene felt a real attachment for the Crown
Prince. He regretted that he had not had the good
fortune to become acquainted with him earlier, and
said to him, &ldquo;My Prince, everything about you convinces
me that you will one day become a great military
leader.&rdquo; Once when Frederick had cordially
saluted the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, who was an old
friend, Eugene turned to him with the words, &ldquo;Will
your Majesty not kiss my old cheek also?&rdquo; a request
with which Frederick immediately complied: a
touching token of the hearty esteem in which the
aspiring young hero held the old retiring one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>In the late Autumn of 1735 peace was made.
The Emperor Charles the Sixth suffered the loss of
some territory in Italy, but had the great satisfaction
of seeing France recognize the Pragmatic Sanction
(the right of accession of the female line of the house
of Hapsburg). Peace! For the present only a
short earthly peace; but the noble Knight was not
far from the eternal rest. But we must touch upon
other things before bringing this sketch to a close.</p>
<p>We have intentionally described Eugene in the
character of a soldier and hero first, and have thus
passed over many events of his life. Let us now
return several years into the past; it will show us
how even the best and greatest of men are subject
to enmity and slander. The reader may remember
Marshal Villars&rsquo;s remark at Rastadt: &ldquo;Eugene&rsquo;s
enemies are not in the French camp, but in Vienna.&rdquo;
Probably Eugene did not let these words trouble
him much at the time, for who is without enemies?
The man is still to be born who is able to please
everybody. But Villars&rsquo;s remark had a significance
which Eugene was to understand better some years
later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>In the last two campaigns against the Turks,
Eugene had conferred the greatest glory on the
Austrian arms. He was the most admired hero in
the imperial army, and possessed the undisputed
love and esteem of his Emperor and of the whole
German people. Although all this gratified the
noble-minded Prince, it did not make him proud
or arrogant, as fools in such a situation are apt to
be. On the contrary, he pursued the even tenor of
his way, flattering no one, though flattery is quite
customary and expected at court. War and a
long life spent in the camp had lent his manner
a certain bluntness. He never tried to conceal his
meaning, and he spoke as he felt. This did not please
many of the courtiers; they took it for granted that
it bespoke a high opinion of his own merits. The
wings of this proud eagle, they thought, who in
eagle fashion aspired to mount to the sun, must be
clipped.</p>
<p>As president of the Royal Council of War&mdash;the
highest dignity in the state next to the Emperor&mdash;Prince
Eugene had a great, if not the greatest influence
in all business of state. Whatever he had once
decided was right and good he would carry out,
whether he was looked askance at for it or not. He
urged the regulation of the finances, which, as we
know, were in bad condition at that time in Austria.
He demanded great economy in all affairs, and abolished
a great many abuses. Among other things
he procured a decree that no one should be allowed
to buy his rank as an officer in the army, but that
only those should be chosen who were really capable
and worthy of the position. Next, he turned his
attention to the corrupt practice of favoritism shown
to distinguished relatives, which at that time was
much in vogue in Vienna. He provided better care
for the soldiers, but demanded also stricter discipline
and subordination in the army. Of course this was
a slap in the face for many. It was especially uncomfortable
for the higher classes, where the greatest
abuses had become habitual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Now, the best cure was a radical one&mdash;to remove
the noble Prince Eugene. But how? It was not
very easy to overthrow such a man as this. The
Spanish party at court understood the matter,
however, and applied the lever at the right point;
in other words, they began with the Emperor Charles
the Sixth, who guarded his prerogatives anxiously
and jealously. He could not endure that any one
should presume to exercise any control over him
even from a distance. So the Spaniards and Frenchmen
whispered in his ear that Eugene was seeking
to become a second Wallenstein; that the army was
on his side; that it was most dangerous to give him
freedom to carry out his ambitious plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Furthermore, Eugene was accused of expressing
himself very openly on political questions in favor
of Hungary, at the house of Countess Batthiany,
a Hungarian. Others declared that he was jealous
of the fame of his subordinates. They said that in
order to test Guido Starhemberg&rsquo;s intrepidity he had
caused bombs to be placed under the table before
a banquet and had them exploded at the moment
when Starhemberg was just about to propose the
Emperor&rsquo;s health; and that Starhemberg was not
at all disconcerted, but had coolly emptied his glass.
Not content with this, they accused Eugene of
having needlessly sacrificed a great many soldiers
in the last war, and of having favored the cavalry
at the expense of the infantry. In short, they found
abundant matter for malicious attacks on him for
his desperate situation at Belgrade where he had
allowed himself to be surrounded by superior
numbers. Of course they prudently failed to recall
his brilliant victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>All this had its effect; these malicious slanders
succeeded in undermining the Emperor&rsquo;s confidence,
which had appeared to be so absolute, and in a short
time produced such a complete revolution in his
sentiments for the Prince that he suddenly regarded
his deeds and aspirations with changed eyes. Indeed,
distrust and entire estrangement took the
place of his former grateful regard. The men who
encouraged this wicked calumny because they wished
to ruin Eugene at all costs and drive him from the
court were miserable tools of the Spanish court
party, particularly of a certain Tedeschi, a spendthrift
abbot, who played the clown and fun-maker
at court, as well as the Count von Nimptsch, brother-in-law
of the Emperor&rsquo;s favorite, Althan. Herr
Althan himself and the Marquis von Thomas, the
ambassador of Duke Victor Amadeus of Savoy,
were also secretly concerned in this disgraceful affair.
But the truth of the old maxim proved itself in this
instance: &ldquo;It is a long road which has no turning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This treachery came to light through another&rsquo;s
treachery. The valet of Count von Nimptsch, an
enthusiastic admirer of the high-minded Prince
Eugene, discovered the tricks of his master, possessed
himself of written proofs of his treachery, took them
to headquarters, and laid them before Prince Eugene.</p>
<p>What a surprise all this vileness was to the Prince!
At first he could not and would not believe it. He
could not imagine that the party had sunk so low.
But there it was, black on white, it was a fact. His
enemies had basely slandered him in order to accomplish
his ruin.</p>
<p>Eugene did not hesitate a moment, but went
straight to the Emperor, not in order to justify himself&mdash;for
with his high character he did not feel it
necessary&mdash;but to demand just punishment of the
miserable slanderers. &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
pernicious plot has been concocted against me.
Miserable slanderers have conspired against my honor
and robbed me of the precious favor of my beloved
Emperor. I demand satisfaction!&rdquo; Eugene then
revealed what had been done behind his back and
named the dishonorable traitors openly. He could
speak in plain terms, for a good conscience was his
best weapon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The Emperor was seized with the most painful
embarrassment; he was silent with surprise&mdash;and
shame.</p>
<p>But this did not satisfy Eugene. &ldquo;I demand full
satisfaction,&rdquo; said he firmly. &ldquo;If this should be
refused me, I shall be obliged to lay all my offices
and honors at Your Majesty&rsquo;s feet. But I shall call
upon all Europe to sit in judgment on the terrible
injury which has been done me in case such an insult
shall remain unpunished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor tried to soothe the aggrieved hero,
embraced him, and expressed the hope that they
might still remain the same good old friends.</p>
<p>But this did not satisfy Eugene. He repeatedly
demanded full satisfaction. He affirmed that the
affair had gone too far for him to be put off with
mere words, and that otherwise he must demand his
dismissal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>The Emperor could not refuse. He gave Eugene
his hand and ordered, in the first place, the arrest
of Nimptsch and Tedeschi. A short time afterwards
a special commission was assembled to conduct the
investigation of the affair. It went forward very
slowly, for the commissioners were loath to compromise
people in high stations. During this time
Eugene did not engage in any business of state, so
that all public affairs came to a standstill. At last
the head of the investigation commission, Count
von Windischgr&auml;tz, made an end of the dilatory
proceedings. He boldly informed the Emperor that
it would be a perpetual disgrace to his Government
if Prince Eugene, to whom the Austrian house owed
eternal gratitude, should become the victim of a
vile intrigue. He begged the Emperor to bring the
guilty ones to justice and to carry out the sentence
of the court without fear or favor. That was effective.
The affair began to move rapidly. On the
morning of the twelfth of December, 1719, the sentence
of Tedeschi was read in front of the Corn
Exchange, the Court House of that day, and was
immediately executed. He was obliged to endure
two hours in the pillory and received thirty heavy
blows of the rod by the executioner. After this procedure
he was driven in a cart outside the K&auml;rnthner
gate to the Tyrol road, where he was made to
take an oath never to return to Austria. Count
Nimptsch was taken in a closed carriage to Gr&auml;tz,
where he had to suffer two years&rsquo; imprisonment,
after which he was forever banished from Vienna.
Althan escaped with a black eye, so to speak, and
the Savoyan ambassador, Marquis von Thomas,
might consider himself lucky in escaping the excited
populace of Vienna unharmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>This was the atonement which the Emperor
Charles the Sixth made to Prince Eugene. After
these events they became as good friends as they had
formerly been, and the Emperor took every opportunity
of showing by word and deed the warmest
devotion to the Prince, as hundreds of personal
letters from the Emperor to his faithful paladin
testify. Eugene&rsquo;s health was of special concern to
the Emperor, to show which a single document will
suffice. A letter from the Emperor, dated November
27, 1729, ended with the very cordial words: &ldquo;I
implore you, my Prince, to take care of your health.
Remember that we are growing older and not
younger. Be careful of yourself, therefore, out of
consideration for me, for I love you and embrace
you heartily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There remains nothing more to tell except of our
hero&rsquo;s peculiarities of temperament, his manner of
life, his character, and his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>First of all we must defend Prince Eugene from
the suspicion that he loved war. He regarded it
as a necessary evil, but when it was no longer to be
avoided he did not fear it. He did not hate the
French and fight against them because the King had
caused him and his family much sorrow and disgrace
in his earliest youth, but because he considered
them Germany&rsquo;s most bitter enemies, as they were
continually seeking at all costs to injure her. He
fought the Turks as the enemies of Christendom.
He had so often seen the horrors of war which these
barbarians had inflicted on the country and its
people that it was no wonder he gladly battled
with them and did everything in his power to deliver
the civilized world from them.</p>
<p>Prince Eugene was a religious man, but did not
parade his piety, as so many do. His modesty
and humility, his untiring care for his soldiers, his
beneficence and charity, were the outpouring of his
religious nature. Eugene never let fall a word in
praise of himself, and was always just to his subordinates
and all his officers. It was also a trait of his
noble character that he never censured deserving men.
If, however, his duty made this necessary, he did it
privately or in the presence of the Emperor, to whom
he was accountable. He was a real father to his
soldiers. He cared for them in every possible way,
visiting the sick and wounded, and comforting the
dying. It was no wonder that they were devoted
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>He exercised an almost magical influence over
them, which we must the more admire, because
Prince Eugene was lacking in all the externals which
usually make the deepest impression on people of
the lower classes and on great masses. For, as we
already know, he was small and insignificant-looking;
besides, he did not understand the German language
any too well, and was lacking in the eloquence which
inflames the soldier to deeds of valor and inspires
him to hasten recklessly into danger. But his affability
and impartiality, his personal courage and
the abandon with which he would place himself at
the head of a storming column, sharing discomfort,
want, misery, heat, and cold with his soldiers, compensated
for the lack of external beauty. Under his
leadership the troops felt themselves to be invincible.
To use an old phrase: under him they would have
undertaken to drive the devil out of hell.</p>
<p>At the same time Eugene had extremely clear
judgment, not only amid the wild confusion of battle,
where, as we have read, this quality very often inclined
the victory to his side by means of prompt
and energetic action, but also in his many other
offices and affairs of state. He was always wise in
the choice of his co-workers, gave them his full
confidence, and scarcely ever was disappointed or
deceived by one of them. As we have said, Eugene
did not understand the German language well, and
could scarcely write it at all. He always signed
German reports or ordinances: &ldquo;Eugenio von Savoy.&rdquo;
This has been explained as follows: Eugene wished
to indicate his extraction by the Italian word &ldquo;Eugenio,&rdquo;
his adopted fatherland by the German &ldquo;von,&rdquo;
and his birthland by the French &ldquo;Savoy.&rdquo; However
that may be, it is certain that Eugene devoted himself
heart and soul to Germany and to the imperial
house to the end of his days. He never forgot that,
as an unknown and virtually banished youth, he
had found a friendly and hospitable reception on
German soil. Eugene&rsquo;s life was a perpetual expression
of gratitude for this; and to Austria in particular
he rendered imperishable services.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>It is historic fact that not only the Emperor Charles
the Sixth, but other competent judges, have acknowledged
these services. King Frederick the Second
of Prussia believed that the reign of Charles the
Sixth closed much less brilliantly than it had begun,
because of the death of Prince Eugene. Some years
later, when that Prussian ruler declared war against
Austria, and Silesia soon fell into his hands, the
imperial chancellor, von Sinzendorff, who had so
often opposed Eugene&rsquo;s counsels, is said to have
declared, in his anxiety, &ldquo;If Eugene were only alive
we should know what to do!&rdquo; Of course, no one
can tell whether Eugene would have had better
success if he had been opposed to Frederick, but it
is certain that Austria could not produce a second
Eugene from among her many warriors and statesmen.
He remained &ldquo;the only,&rdquo; &ldquo;the great Eugene.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The last campaigns against the French (1734-1735)
had shattered his already much impaired
health. He was troubled with a bad cough, so that
for days together he was not able to speak a word.
Then a short period of relief would come, so that he
could attend to public and private business or spend
an hour with some old friend. One of his favorite
recreations was to visit the venerable and gifted
Hungarian Countess Batthiany of an evening for
a game of piquet. His closed carriage passed slowly
through the streets, and the horses are said to have
known the house and to have stopped there of their
own accord. But very likely no one would get out,
for the master, the coachman, and the servant were
all napping. Each one had then to be aroused
separately, which no doubt caused a great deal of
merriment each time. He had become very old and
tired. The hardships of war had greatly weakened
him, and the eighteen wounds which he had received
in fourteen great battles and countless skirmishes
also counted against him. He had passed the limit
which the sacred book sets to human life.</p>
<p>On the twentieth of April, 1736, he had had his
game of cards as usual in the society of the Countess
Batthiany, but had been exceptionally quiet. On
his arrival at home he complained that breathing
was difficult, but refused to see a doctor and went
to bed! About midnight, when his faithful old servant
went in once more to look after his beloved
master, he found him sleeping quietly, and softly
withdrew. The next morning the servant noticed
that his master was sleeping unusually late, also
that he had not heard him cough. So he opened
the door and approached the Prince&rsquo;s bed. He was
dead; a congestion of the lungs had quietly ended
his active and useful life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>When the news of the Prince&rsquo;s demise became
known in Vienna, it produced general dismay and
deep mourning. No one was more deeply grieved
than the Emperor. He gave orders for a funeral
such as no Austrian subject had ever had before,
to honor the hero. &ldquo;It shall serve to show,&rdquo; said
the Emperor, &ldquo;that the services of the departed
shall never be forgotten by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost the whole population of Vienna flocked
to see the Prince as he lay in state. Fourteen
Field-Marshals were the pall-bearers, and the grateful
Emperor himself attended the funeral services
in the Cathedral of Saint Stephen. The eloquent
Father Peickart preached the sermon on the text:
&ldquo;And departing, he has left us an example in his
death which should be an inspiration to virtue, for
the young as well as the old.&rdquo;</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
